II
General Epanchin lived house near Litaynaya Besides
large residence let flats lodgings
general owner another enormous house Sadovaya bringing
even rent first Besides houses delightful
little estate town sort factory another part
city General Epanchin everyone knew good deal
certain government monopolies also voice
important one many rich public companies various descriptions
fact enjoyed reputation man busy
habits many ties affluent means He made indispensable
several quarters amongst others department government
yet known fact Fedor Ivanovitch Epanchin man
education whatever absolutely risen ranks
This last fact could course reflect nothing credit upon
general yet though unquestionably sagacious man
little weaknesses excusable ones one dislike
allusion circumstance He undoubtedly clever For
instance made point never asserting would
gain keeping background consequence many exalted
personages valued principally humility simplicity
knew And yet good people could
peep mind excellent fellow knew
place well The fact spite knowledge world
really remarkable abilities always liked appear
carrying people ideas rather And also
luck seldom failed even cards passion
attempt conceal He played high stakes moved
altogether varied society
As age General Epanchin prime life
years age flowering time existence
real enjoyment life begins His healthy appearance good colour
sound though discoloured teeth sturdy figure preoccupied air
business hours jolly good humour game cards
evening bore witness success life combined make
existence bed roses excellency The general lord
flourishing family consisting wife three daughters
He married young still lieutenant wife girl
age possessed neither beauty education

princely stock Muishkin brilliant
events decidedly ancient family extremely proud
descent
With exceptions worthy couple lived long
union happily While still young wife able make
important friends among aristocracy partly virtue family
descent partly exertions life thanks
wealth position husband service
took place among higher circles right
During last years three general
daughters Alexandra Adelaida Aglaya grown matured Of
course Epanchins mother family noble
might expect considerable fortunes father hopes
attaining high rank indeed country service
satisfactory All three girls decidedly pretty even
eldest Alexandra years old The middle
daughter youngest Aglaya twenty
This youngest girl absolutely beauty begun late
attract considerable attention society But
every one three clever well educated accomplished
It matter general knowledge three girls fond
one another supported every way even said
two elder ones made certain sacrifices sake
idol household Aglaya In society disliked
asserting actually retiring Certainly one could
blame arrogant haughty yet everybody well
aware proud quite understood value The
eldest musical second clever artist fact
concealed lately In word world spoke well
girls without enemies occasionally people
talked horror number books read
They hurry marry They liked good society
keen All remarkable everyone
well aware hopes aims parents
It eleven clock forenoon prince rang
bell General Epanchin door The general lived first floor
flat house modest lodging position permitted A
liveried servant opened door prince obliged enter
long explanations gentleman first glance
looked bundle grave suspicion At last however
repeated positive assurance really Prince Muishkin
must absolutely see general business bewildered domestic
showed little leading
adjoined general study handing another servant
whose duty morning
announce visitors general This second individual wore dress
coat forty years age general special
study servant well aware importance
Wait next room please leave bundle said
sat comfortably
He looked prince severe surprise latter
settled another chair alongside bundle
knees
If mind I would rather sit said prince
I prefer sitting
Oh stay You visitor guest speak
Is general wish see
The man evidently could take idea
visitor decided ask
Yes I business began prince
I ask business may I
announce unless secretary comes I
The man suspicions seemed increase The prince
unlike usual run daily visitors although general
certainly receive business sorts conditions men yet
spite fact servant felt great doubts subject
particular visitor The presence secretary
intermediary judged essential case
Surely abroad inquired last confused sort
way He begun sentence intending say Surely
Prince Muishkin
Yes straight train Did intend say Surely
Prince Muishkin refrained politeness
H grunted astonished servant
I assure I deceiving shall answer
As dressed like carrying bundle
nothing surprising fact circumstances
particularly rosy moment
H I afraid see I announce
The secretary directly unless yes
rub unless come must allow ask

three hours however like
Now earth I announce man like muttered
servant In first place right ought

evidently gave peace
No I think I think I stay even
invite I simply come make acquaintance nothing
Make acquaintance asked man amazement
redoubled suspicion Then say business
general
Oh well little business There one little matter
advice I going ask principal object simply
introduce I Prince Muishkin Madame Epanchin
last branch house besides
Muishkins left
What relation asked servant
bewildered began feel quite alarmed
Well hardly If stretch point relations course
distant one really take cognizance I
wrote mistress abroad reply However I
thought right make acquaintance arrival I
telling order ease mind I see still
far comfortable account All announce
Prince Muishkin object visit plain enough If
I received good well good But
sure receive I think Madame Epanchin naturally
curious see remaining representative family She
values Muishkin descent highly I rightly informed
The prince conversation artless confiding degree
servant could help feeling visitor common
state things highly improper His conclusion
one two things must explanation either
begging impostor prince prince simply
fool without slightest ambition sensible prince
ambition would certainly wait servants
talk private affairs like In either case
announce singular visitor
I really think I must request step next room said
insistence could muster
Why If I sitting I
opportunity making personal explanations I see still
uneasy keep eyeing cloak bundle Don think
might go without waiting secretary come
No I announce visitor like without secretary
Besides general said disturbed
Colonel C Gavrila Ardalionovitch goes without announcing
Who may clerk
What Gavrila Ardalionovitch Oh belongs one
companies Look events put bundle
Yes I I may I take cloak
Of course go anyhow
The prince rose took mantle revealing neat enough morning
costume little worn well made He wore steel watch chain
chain hung silver Geneva watch Fool prince might
still general servant felt correct
continue converse thus visitor spite fact
prince pleased somehow
And time day lady receive latter asked
reseating old place
Oh province I believe receives time
depends upon visitors The dressmaker goes eleven Gavrila
Ardalionovitch allowed much earlier people
even admitted early lunch
It much warmer rooms abroad season
observed prince much warmer doors As
houses Russian live winter gets
accustomed
Don heat
Well heat little houses stoves
different
H long away
Four years I place nearly time one
village
You must forgotten Russia
Yes indeed I good deal would believe I often
wonder forgotten speak Russian Even
I talk I keep saying well I speaking
Perhaps partly I talkative morning I assure
ever since yesterday evening I strongest desire go
talking Russian
H yes live Petersburg former years
This good flunkey spite conscientious scruples really could
resist continuing genteel agreeable conversation
In Petersburg Oh hardly say much
changed place even know well obliged
relearn knew They talk good deal new law courts
changes
H yes true enough Well law
administer justly
Oh I know I heard much good
legal administration There capital punishment one
thing
Is
Yes I saw execution France Lyons Schneider took
see
What hang fellow
No cut people heads France
What fellow yell
Oh work instant They put man inside frame
sort broad knife falls machinery call thing
guillotine falls fearful force weight head springs
quickly wink eye But
preparations dreadful When announce sentence know
prepare criminal tie hands cart
scaffold fearful part business The people crowd
round even women though approve women looking
No thing women
Of course course bah The criminal fine intelligent
fearless man Le Gros name I may tell believe
like man stepped upon scaffold
indeed white bit paper Isn dreadful
idea cried cried Whoever heard grown man
crying fear child man never cried
grown man years Imagine must going
man mind moment dreadful convulsions whole
spirit must endured outrage soul
Because said thou shalt kill killed
murdered one else No right impossible
theory I assure I saw sight month ago dancing
eyes moment I dream often
The prince grown animated spoke tinge colour
suffused pale face though way talking quiet ever
The servant followed words sympathetic interest Clearly
anxious bring conversation end Who knows
Perhaps man imagination capacity
thought
Well events good thing pain
poor fellow head flies remarked
Do know though cried prince warmly made remark
everyone says thing machine designed
purpose avoiding pain guillotine I mean thought came
head bad plan You may laugh
idea perhaps I could help occurring
Now rack tortures suffer terrible pain
course torture bodily pain although doubt
plenty die But I imagine
terrible part whole punishment bodily pain
certain knowledge hour ten minutes
half minute soul must
quit body longer man
certain That point certainty Just
instant place head block hear iron grate
head quarter second awful
This fantastical opinion many people thought
I feel deeply I tell I think I believe
execute man murder punish immeasurably
dreadfully equivalent crime A murder sentence
far dreadful murder committed criminal The man
attacked robbers night dark wood anywhere undoubtedly
hopes hopes may yet escape moment
death There plenty instances man running away imploring
mercy events hoping degree even throat
cut But case execution last hope
immeasurably less dreadful die taken away
wretch substituted place There sentence
terrible certainty possibly escape
death I consider must dreadful anguish
world You may place soldier cannon mouth battle
fire upon still hope But read soldier
either go mad burst tears Who dares
say man suffer without going mad No
abuse shame unnecessary thing exist
Doubtless may men sentenced suffered
mental anguish reprieved perhaps
men may able relate feelings afterwards Our
Lord Christ spoke anguish dread No No man
treated man man
The servant though course could expressed
prince still clearly entered greatly
conciliated evident increased amiability
expression If really anxious smoke remarked
I think might possibly managed quick
You see might come inquire
spot You see door Go find little
room right smoke open window I
ought allow really But time
A young fellow entered moment bundle
papers hand The footman hastened help take
overcoat The new arrival glanced prince corners
eyes

confidentially almost familiarly Prince Muishkin
relative Madame Epanchin He arrived abroad
nothing bundle way luggage
The prince hear rest point servant
continued communication whisper
Gavrila Ardalionovitch listened attentively gazed prince
great curiosity At last motioned man aside stepped
hurriedly towards prince
Are Prince Muishkin asked greatest courtesy
amiability
He remarkably handsome young fellow summers
fair middle height wore small beard face
intelligent Yet smile spite sweetness little
thin I may call showed teeth evenly
gaze though decidedly ingenuous trifle
inquisitive intent altogether agreeable
Probably alone looks quite different hardly smiles
thought prince
He explained words much
told footman Rogojin beforehand
Gavrila Ardalionovitch meanwhile seemed trying recall
something

The general left room prince never succeeded broaching
business hand though endeavoured
four times
Gania lit cigarette offered one prince The latter accepted
offer talk unwilling disturb Gania work
He commenced examine study contents But Gania hardly
much glanced papers lying absent
thoughtful smile general appearance struck prince still

Hardly prince uttered last word Gania gave

apartments announced footman appearing door
The prince immediately followed man room
IV
All three Miss Epanchins fine healthy girls
good shoulders busts strong almost masculine hands
course attributes enjoyed capital
appetites least ashamed
Elizabetha Prokofievna sometimes informed girls
little candid matter spite outward
deference mother three young women solemn conclave
long agreed modify unquestioning obedience
habit according General Epanchin
judged better say nothing though course
well aware fact
It true nature sometimes rebelled dictates
reason grew yearly capricious impatient
respectful husband thumb
times found possible rule empty little
accumulations spleen upon head therefore harmony
family kept duly balanced things went smoothly family
matters
Epanchin fair appetite generally took share
capital lunch always served girls
nearly good dinner The young ladies used
cup coffee meal ten clock still bed
This favourite unalterable arrangement At
twelve table laid small occasionally
general appeared family gathering time
Besides tea coffee cheese honey butter various
kinds lady house loved best cutlets
generally strong beef soup substantial delicacies
On particular morning story opened family
assembled waiting general appearance
latter promised come day If one moment
late would sent turned punctually
As came forward wish wife kiss hands
custom observed something look boded ill He
thought knew reason expected still
altogether comfortable His daughters advanced kiss
though look exactly angry something strange
expression well
The general owing certain circumstances little inclined
suspicious home needlessly nervous experienced
father husband judged better take measures
protect dangers might air
However I hope I shall interfere proper sequence
narrative much I diverge moment point order
explain mutual relations General Epanchin family
others acting part history time take
thread destiny I already stated general though
man lowly origin poor education
experienced talented husband father Among things
considered undesirable hurry daughters matrimonial
altar worry much assurances paternal wishes
happiness custom among parents many
daughters He even succeeded ranging wife side
question though found feat difficult accomplish
unnatural general arguments conclusive founded upon
obvious facts The general considered girls taste good
sense allowed develop mature deliberately
parents duty merely keep watch order strange
undesirable choice made selection effected
father mother bound moment enter heart
soul cause see matter progressed without
hindrance altar happily reached
Besides clear Epanchins position gained
year geometrical accuracy financial solidity
social weight therefore longer girls waited better
chance making brilliant match
But amidst incontrovertible facts recorded one
equally significant rose confront family
eldest daughter Alexandra imperceptibly arrived
birthday Almost moment Afanasy Ivanovitch
Totski man immense wealth high connections good standing
announced intention marrying Afanasy Ivanovitch gentleman
years age artistically gifted refined
tastes He wished marry well moreover keen admirer
judge beauty
Now since Totski late upon terms great cordiality
Epanchin excellent relations intensified fact
speak partners several financial enterprises
happened former put friendly request general
counsel regard important step meditated Might
suggest instance thing marriage
one general daughters
Evidently quiet pleasant current family life
Epanchins undergo change
The undoubted beauty family youngest
Aglaya aforesaid But Totski though egotist
extremest type realized chance Aglaya clearly
Perhaps sisterly love friendship three girls
less exaggerated Aglaya chances happiness In opinion
latter destiny merely happy live
heaven earth Aglaya husband compendium
virtues success speak fabulous wealth The two
elder sisters agreed sacrificed need
Aglaya sake dowry colossal unprecedented
The general wife aware agreement therefore
Totski suggested one sisters parents made
doubt one two elder girls would probably accept
offer since Totski would certainly make difficulty dowry The
general valued proposal highly He knew life realized
offer worth
The answer sisters communication conclusive
least consoling hopeful It made known eldest
Alexandra would likely disposed listen proposal
Alexandra girl though She
intelligent marry Totski
would make good wife She care brilliant marriage
eminently woman calculated soothe sweeten life
man decidedly pretty absolutely handsome What better could
Totski wish
So matter crept slowly forward The general Totski agreed
avoid hasty irrevocable step Alexandra parents even
begun talk daughters freely upon subject suddenly
dissonant chord struck amid harmony
proceedings Epanchin began show signs discontent
serious matter A certain circumstance crept
disagreeable troublesome factor threatened overturn
whole business
This circumstance come existence eighteen years Close
estate Totski one central provinces Russia
lived time poor gentleman whose estate
wretchedest description This gentleman noted district
persistent name Barashkoff regards
family descent vastly superior Totski estate
mortgaged last acre One day ridden town
see creditor chief peasant village followed shortly
news house burnt
wife perished children safe
Even Barashkoff inured storms evil fortune could
stand last stroke He went mad died shortly
town hospital His estate sold creditors little
girls two seven eight years age respectively
adopted Totski undertook maintenance education
kindness heart They brought together children
German bailiff Very soon however one
left Nastasia Philipovna little one died
Totski living abroad time soon
forgot child five years returning Russia
struck would like look estate see
matters going arrived bailiff house
long discovering among children latter
dwelt lovely little girl twelve sweet intelligent
bright promising develop beauty unusual quality
last Totski undoubted authority
He stayed country seat days occasion
time make arrangements Great changes took place
child education good governess engaged Swiss lady
experience culture For four years lady resided house
little Nastia education considered complete
The governess took departure another lady came fetch
Nastia Totski instructions The child transported
another Totski estates distant part country Here
found delightful little house built prepared
reception great care taste took abode
together lady accompanied old home In
house two experienced maids musical instruments
sorts charming young lady library pictures
everything make life agreeable Within fortnight
Totski arrived time appeared taken
great fancy part world came summer staying
two three months time So passed four years peacefully
happily charming surroundings
At end time four months Totski last
visit stayed fortnight occasion report reached
Nastasia Philipovna married Petersburg
rich eminent lovely woman The report partially
true marriage project embryo condition
great change came Nastasia Philipovna She suddenly displayed
unusual decision character without wasting time thought
left country home came Petersburg straight
Totski house alone
The latter amazed conduct began express displeasure
soon became aware must change voice style
everything else young lady good old times gone An
entirely new different woman sat
girl left country last July seemed nothing
common
In first place new woman understood good deal
usual young people age much indeed Totski could
help wondering picked knowledge Surely
young lady library It even embraced legal matters
world general considerable extent
Her character absolutely changed No girlish
alternations timidity petulance adorable naivete
reveries tears playfulness It entirely new
hitherto unknown sat laughed informed
face never faintest feeling
kind except loathing contempt contempt followed closely
upon sensations surprise bewilderment first
acquaintance
This new woman gave understand though
absolutely married yet decided
prevent marriage particular reason
wished amuse expense
quite turn laugh little
Such words likely give real reason
eccentric conduct events explanation
deigned offer
Meanwhile Totski thought matter well scattered ideas
would permit His meditations lasted fortnight however
end time resolution taken The fact Totski
time man fifty years age position solid
respectable place society long firmly fixed upon safe
foundations loved personal comforts position
better world every respectable gentleman
At time grasp things general soon showed Totski
deal outside pale ordinary
rules traditional behaviour would threaten mischief
would undoubtedly carry stop one
There evidently concluded something work storm
mind paroxysm romantic anger goodness knows
insatiable contempt word something altogether
absurd impossible time dangerous met
respectable person position society keep
For man Totski wealth standing would course
simplest possible matter take steps would rid
annoyance obviously impossible Nastasia
Philipovna harm way either legally stirring
scandal case latter danger could easily remove
sphere safety However arguments would hold good
case Nastasia acting others might emergency She
much likely overstep bounds reasonable conduct
extraordinary eccentricity
Here sound judgment Totski stood good stead He realized
Nastasia Philipovna must well aware could nothing
legal means injure flashing eyes betrayed
entirely different intention
Nastasia Philipovna quite capable ruining even
perpetrating something would send Siberia mere
pleasure injuring man developed inhuman sense
loathing contempt He sufficient insight understand
valued nothing world least made
attempt conceal fact coward respects For
instance told would stabbed altar
publicly insulted would undoubtedly frightened
much idea murdered wounded insulted
thought things happen would made look
ridiculous eyes society
He knew well Nastasia thoroughly understood wound
therefore marriage still embryo
Totski decided conciliate giving His decision
strengthened fact Nastasia Philipovna curiously altered
late It would difficult conceive different
physically present time girl years ago She
pretty Totski laughed angrily thought
In days gone remembered
looked beautiful eyes even marvelled
dark mysterious depths wondering gaze seemed seek
answer unknown riddle Her complexion also altered She
exceedingly pale curiously change made
beautiful Like men world Totski rather despised
conquest late years begun think
differently It struck long ago last spring
ought finding good match Nastasia instance
respectable reasonable young fellow serving government office
another part country How maliciously Nastasia laughed
idea thing
However appeared Totski might make use another
way determined establish Petersburg surrounding
comforts luxuries wealth could command In
way might gain glory certain circles
Five years Petersburg life went course
time great deal happened Totski position uncomfortable
funked could totally regain ease He
afraid know simply Nastasia
Philipovna For first two years suspected
wished marry vanity prevented
telling He thought wanted approach
humble proposal side But great entirely
pleasurable amazement discovered means case
offer would refused He could
understand state things obliged conclude
pride pride injured imaginative woman
gone lengths preferred sit nurse contempt
hatred solitude rather mount heights hitherto unattainable
splendour To make matters worse quite impervious mercenary
considerations could bribed way
Finally Totski took cunning means try break chains
free He tried tempt various ways lose heart
invited princes hussars secretaries embassies poets novelists
even Socialists see one made faintest
impression upon Nastasia It though pebble place
heart though feelings affections dried
withered ever
She lived almost entirely alone read studied loved music
Her principal acquaintances poor women various grades couple
actresses family poor schoolteacher Among people
much beloved
She received four five friends sometimes evening Totski
often came Lately General Epanchin enabled
great difficulty introduce circle Gania made
acquaintance also others Ferdishenko
witty young clerk Ptitsin modest
polished manners risen poverty In fact Nastasia
Philipovna beauty became thing known town
single man could boast anything admiration
reputation wit culture grace
confirmed Totski plan prepared
And moment General Epanchin began play large
important part story
When Totski approached general request friendly
counsel marriage one daughters made full
candid confession He said intended stop means
obtain freedom even Nastasia promise leave
entirely alone future would said believe trust
words enough must solid guarantees
sort So general determined try attempt appeal
heart would effect Having arrived Nastasia house one day
Epanchin Totski immediately began speak intolerable
torment position He admitted blame
candidly confessed could bring feel remorse
original guilt towards man sensual
passions inborn ineradicable power
respect wished seriously marry
last whole fate desirable social union
contemplated hands word confided
generosity heart
General Epanchin took part spoke character father
family spoke sensibly without wasting words
attempt sentimentality merely recorded full admission
right arbiter Totski destiny moment He
pointed fate daughter likely
daughters hung upon reply
To Nastasia question wished Totski
confessed frightened five years ago
could never entirely comfortable married He
immediately added suggestion would course
absurd unless accompanied remarks pointed nature He
well knew said certain young gentleman good family
namely Gavrila Ardalionovitch Ivolgin acquainted
received house long loved passionately
would give life response The young fellow
confessed love Totski also admitted
hearing benefactor General Epanchin Lastly could
help opinion Nastasia must aware Gania love
Totski mistook looked favour
upon often lonely rather tired present life
Having remarked difficult people speak
matters Totski concluded saying trusted
Nastasia Philipovna would look contempt upon
expressed sincere desire guarantee future gift
thousand roubles He added sum would
left therefore must
consider gift way indemnification anything
reason man allowed
entertain natural desire lighten conscience etc
fact would naturally said circumstances Totski
eloquent conclusion touched
fact soul world even General Epanchin ever
heard word thousand roubles
first time ever given expression intentions
respect
Nastasia Philipovna reply long rigmarole astonished
friends considerably
Not trace former irony old hatred
enmity dreadful laughter recollection
sent cold chill Totski back day seemed
charmed really glad opportunity talking seriously
way She confessed long wished
frank free conversation ask friendly advice
pride hitherto prevented however ice
broken nothing could welcome opportunity
First sad smile twinkle merriment
eyes admitted storm five years ago
quite question She said long since changed
views things recognized facts must taken
consideration spite feelings heart What done
done ended could understand Totski still
feel alarmed
She next turned General Epanchin observed courteously
long since known daughters heard none
good report learned think deep
sincere respect The idea alone could way serve
would pride source real happiness
It true lonely present life Totski judged
thoughts aright She longed rise love least
family life new hopes objects Gavrila Ardalionovitch
could yet say much She thought must case
loved felt might learn love could
sure firmness attachment
young difficult question decide What specially
liked worked supported family
toil
She heard proud ambitious heard much
interesting mother sister heard Mr
Ptitsin would much like make acquaintance another
question would like receive house At
events though reject idea marriage desired
hurried As thousand roubles Totski
need found difficulty awkwardness matter
quite understood value money would course accept
gift She thanked delicacy however saw reason
Gavrila Ardalionovitch know
She would marry latter said felt persuaded
neither part part family exist
sort concealed suspicions She intend ask
forgiveness anything past fact desired
known She consider blame anything
happened former years thought Gavrila Ardalionovitch
informed relations existed
Totski last five years If accepted money
considered indemnification misfortune young
girl degree fault merely
compensation ruined life
She became excited agitated explanations
confessions General Epanchin highly gratified considered
matter satisfactorily arranged But bitten
Totski twice shy looked hidden snakes among flowers
However special point two friends particularly trusted
bring object namely Gania attractiveness Nastasia
Philipovna stood prominently pourparlers
commenced gradually even Totski began believe possibility
success
Before long Nastasia Gania talked matter Very
little said modesty seemed suffer infliction
discussing question But recognized love
understanding bound nothing whatever
reserved right say hour marriage
ceremony Gania right refusal last
moment
It soon became clear Gania scenes wrath quarrellings
domestic hearth family seriously opposed
match Nastasia aware fact equally evident She
said nothing though daily expected
There several rumours afloat long upset Totski
equanimity good deal stop describe
merely mentioning instance two One Nastasia entered
close secret relations Epanchin girls unlikely
rumour another Nastasia long satisfied fact
Gania merely marrying money nature
gloomy greedy impatient selfish extraordinary degree
although keen enough desire achieve
conquest yet since two friends agreed exploit
passion purposes clear enough begun
consider whole thing nuisance nightmare
In heart passion hate seemed hold divided sway although
last given consent marry woman said
stress circumstances yet promised would take
marriage
Nastasia seemed Totski divined preparing
something account frightened extent
dare communicate views even general But
times would pluck courage full hope good spirits
acting fact weak men act circumstances
However friends felt thing looked rosy indeed
one day Nastasia informed would give final answer
evening birthday anniversary due short

case strange extremely rare occurrence This man
brought scaffold company several others
sentence death shooting passed upon
political crime Twenty minutes later reprieved
punishment substituted interval two
sentences twenty minutes least quarter hour
passed certainty within minutes must die I
anxious hear speak impressions dreadful
time I several times inquired thought
felt He remembered everything accurate extraordinary
distinctness declared would never forget single iota
experience
About twenty paces scaffold stood hear
sentence three posts fixed ground fasten
criminals several The first three criminals
taken posts dressed long white tunics white caps drawn
faces could see rifles pointed
Then group soldiers took stand opposite post My
friend eighth list therefore would
among third lot go A priest went among
cross five minutes time left live
He said five minutes seemed interminable
period enormous wealth time seemed living
minutes many lives need yet think
last moment made several arrangements dividing time
portions one saying farewell companions two minutes
couple thinking life career
another minute last look around He
remembered divided time like quite well While saying
friends recollected asking one
usual everyday question much interested answer Then
bade farewell embarked upon two minutes
allotted looking knew beforehand going
think He wished put quickly clearly
possible living thinking man three
minutes would nobody somebody something
He thought would decide question
last three minutes A little way stood church
gilded spire glittered sun He remembered staring stubbornly
spire rays light sparkling He could
tear eyes rays light got idea rays
new nature three minutes would become one
amalgamated somehow
The repugnance must ensue almost immediately
uncertainty dreadful said worst idea
What I I die What I return
life What eternity days mine How I grudge
count every minute waste single instant
He said thought weighed upon became terrible
burden upon brain could bear wished would
shoot quickly done
The prince paused waited expecting go
finish story
Is asked Aglaya
All Yes said prince emerging momentary reverie
And tell us
Oh I happened recall It fitted
conversation
You probably wish deduce prince said Alexandra moments
time reckoned money value sometimes five minutes
worth priceless treasures All praiseworthy may I
ask friend told terrible experience
life He reprieved say words restore
eternity What riches time
Did keep careful account minutes
Oh I asked He said lived
bit intended wasted many many minute
Very well experiment thing proved one
live count moment say like one
That true said prince I thought And yet
one
You think could live wisely people
said Aglaya
I idea
And still
Yes I still prince replied
He contemplated Aglaya pleasant though rather
timid smile last words fell lips began laugh
looked merrily
You modest said
But brave said You laughing I man
tale impressed much I dreamt afterwards yes I dreamt
five minutes
He looked listeners serious searching
expression
You angry asked suddenly kind
nervous hurry although looked straight face
Why angry cried
Only I seem giving lecture time
At laughed heartily
Please angry continued prince I know well
I seen less life people less knowledge
I must appear speak strangely sometimes
He said last words nervously
You say happy proves lived less
people Why make excuses interrupted
Aglaya mocking tone voice Besides need mind
lecturing us nothing boast With quietism one
could live happily hundred years least One might show
execution felon show one little finger You could draw
moral either quite satisfied That sort existence
easy enough
I understand always fly temper said Mrs
Epanchin listening conversation examining
faces speakers turn I understand mean What
little finger The prince talks well though
amusing He began right seems sad
Never mind mamma Prince I wish seen execution said
Aglaya I like ask question
I seen execution said prince
You cried Aglaya I might guessed That fitting
crown rest story If seen execution
say lived happily
But capital punishment asked Adelaida
I saw Lyons Schneider took us soon arrived
came
Well like much Was edifying
instructive asked Aglaya
No I like ill seeing I confess
I stared though eyes fixed sight I could tear
away
I unable tear eyes away said Aglaya
They approve women going see execution
The women go condemned afterwards newspapers
That contending sight women admit
sight men I congratulate deduction I suppose
quite agree prince
Tell us execution put Adelaida
I would much rather said prince little disturbed
frowning slightly
You seem want tell us said Aglaya mocking air
No thing I telling execution little
ago
Whom tell
The I waiting see general
Our exclaimed several voices
Yes one waits entrance hall greyish
man
The prince clearly democrat remarked Aglaya
Well could tell Aleksey surely tell us
I want hear repeated Adelaida
Just I confess began prince animation
asked subject picture I confess I serious thoughts
giving one I thought asking draw face
criminal one minute fall guillotine
wretched man still standing scaffold preparatory placing
neck block
What face face asked Adelaida That would
strange subject indeed And sort picture would make
Oh prince insisted warmth When I
Basle I saw picture much style I like tell
I time struck forcibly
Oh shall tell us Basle picture another time must
execution said Adelaida Tell us face
appeared imagination drawn
face alone mean
It minute execution began prince readily
carried away recollection evidently forgetting everything
else moment instant stepped ladder
scaffold He happened look direction I saw eyes
understood I describe I wish
somebody else could draw possible I thought time
picture would make You must imagine went
course He lived prison time
expected execution would take place least week yet
counted formalities taking time
happened papers got ready quickly At five clock
morning asleep October five morning
cold dark The governor prison comes
touches sleeping man shoulder gently He starts What
says The execution fixed ten He
awake would believe first began argue
papers would week When wide awake
realized truth became silent argued
say bit said It comes hard one
suddenly silent said nothing
The three four hours went course necessary
preparations priest breakfast coffee meat wine
gave seem ridiculous And yet I believe people
give good breakfast pure kindness heart believe
good action Then dressed begins
procession town scaffold I think
must feel age live still cart along
Probably thought way Oh I long long time yet
Three streets life yet When passed street
one one baker shop
right shall get It ages ages Around
crowds shouting yelling ten thousand faces twenty thousand eyes
All endured especially thought Here ten
thousand men one going executed yet I
Well preparatory
At scaffold ladder burst
tears strong man terribly wicked one say
There priest whole time talking even cart
drove along talked talked Probably heard
nothing would begin listen third word
forgotten
At last began mount steps legs tied
take small steps The priest seemed wise man
stopped talking held cross wretched fellow
kiss At foot ladder pale enough set
foot scaffold top face suddenly became colour
paper positively like white notepaper His legs must become
suddenly feeble helpless felt choking throat
know sudden feeling one moments terrible fear one
lose one wits absolutely powerless move If
dreadful thing suddenly happen house
fall one know one would long sit shut
one eyes wait wait Well terrible feeling came
priest quickly pressed cross lips without
word little silver cross kept pressing
man lips every second And whenever cross touched lips
eyes would open moment legs moved kissed
cross greedily hurriedly though anxious catch hold
something case useful afterwards though
could hardly connected religious thoughts time And
block
How strange criminals seldom swoon moment On
contrary brain especially active works
incessantly probably hard hard hard like engine full pressure
I imagine various thoughts must beat loud fast
head unfinished ones strange funny thoughts
likely like instance That man looking
wart forehead executioner burst one
buttons lowest one rusty And meanwhile notices
remembers everything There one point forgotten round
everything else dances turns
point faint lasts final quarter
second wretched neck block victim listens
waits point
die listens rasp iron head If I
lay I certainly listen grating sound hear
There would probably tenth part instant left
hear one would certainly hear And imagine people
declare head flies flown
Just imagine thing realize Fancy consciousness
last even five seconds
Draw scaffold top step ladder comes
clearly The criminal must stepping face white
The priest holding cross blue lips
criminal kisses knows sees understands everything
The cross head picture priest
executioner two assistants heads eyes
Those might come subordinate accessories sort mist There
picture The prince paused looked around
Certainly much like quietism murmured Alexandra half
Now tell us love affairs said Adelaida moment
pause
The prince gazed amazement
You know Adelaida continued owe us description Basle
picture first I wish hear fell love Don deny
fact course Besides stop philosophizing
telling anything
Why ashamed stories moment told
asked Aglaya suddenly
How silly said Epanchin looking indignantly towards

VI
Here began prince settling
listen much curiosity I satisfy
probably angry No I joking added
hastily smile
Well children I always among
children children They children village
I lived went school I
teach oh master one Jules Thibaut
I may taught things I among
outsider I passed four years life among
I wished nothing better I used tell everything hid
nothing Their fathers relations angry
children could nothing without last used
throng times The schoolmaster greatest enemy
end I many enemies children Even
Schneider reproached What afraid One tell child
everything anything I often struck fact parents
know children little They conceal much
How well even little children understand parents
conceal things consider young
understand Children capable giving advice important
matters How one deceive dear little birds look
one sweetly confidingly I call birds
nothing world better birds
However people angry one
thing Thibaut simply jealous At first wagged
head wondered children understood I told
well could learn laughed like anything
I replied neither I could teach much
might teach us good deal
How could hate tell scandalous stories living among
children I understand Children soothe
heal wounded heart I remember one poor fellow
professor treated madness idea

terribly unhappy But I tell another day Now
I must get story
The children love first I sickly awkward

The children used laugh first even went far
throw stones saw kiss Marie I kissed

If knew miserable creature would
pitied I She belonged village Her mother
old old woman used sell string thread soap
tobacco window little house lived

could hardly move Marie daughter girl twenty weak
thin consumptive still heavy work houses
around day day Well one fine day commercial traveller betrayed
carried week later deserted She came home
dirty draggled shoeless walked whole week without
shoes slept fields caught terrible cold feet
swollen sore hands torn scratched She

kind eyes
She quiet always I remember suddenly
begun singing work everyone said Marie tried sing today
got chaffed silent ever She

Cruel people Oh hazy understandings

wrathfully unkindly contempt You disgraced
said She first cast ignominy
heard Marie returned village ran see
crowded little cottage old men children women
girls hurrying stamping greedy crowd Marie lying
floor old woman feet hungry torn draggled crying
miserable
When everyone crowded room hid face dishevelled
hair lay cowering floor Everyone looked though

insect
Her mother allowed go nodded head
encouraged The old woman ill time knew
dying really die couple months later though
felt end approaching never thought forgiving daughter
day death She would even speak She made
sleep straw shed hardly gave food enough support
life
Marie gentle mother nursed everything
old woman accepted services without word
never showed slightest kindness Marie bore
I could see I got know thought quite right
fitting considering lowest meanest creatures
When old woman took bed finally old women
village sat turns custom Marie
quite driven house They gave food
could get work village none would employ The men
seemed consider longer woman said dreadful things
Sometimes Sundays drunk enough used
throw penny two mud Marie would silently pick
money She began spit blood time
At last rags became tattered torn ashamed
appearing village longer The children used pelt
mud begged taken assistant cowherd cowherd
would Then took helping without leave
saw valuable assistance drive away
contrary occasionally gave remnants
dinner bread cheese He considered kind
When mother died village parson ashamed hold Marie
public derision shame Marie standing coffin
head rags crying
A crowd people collected see would cry The parson
young fellow ambitious becoming great preacher began sermon
pointed Marie There said cause death
venerable woman lie ill

virtue Who daughter end
And fancy infamy pleased nearly Only
children altered side learned

This I wished something Marie I longed

I long sought meet Marie alone last I meet
hillside beyond village I gave eight francs asked
take care money I could get I kissed

motives I love I solely
pity first I accounted
guilty much unfortunate I longed console encourage
somehow assure low base thing
others strove make I think understood
She stood dreadfully ashamed downcast
eyes I finished kissed hand I would kissed
drew away Just moment whole troop
children saw us I found afterwards long kept
watch upon They began whistling clapping hands
laughing us Marie ran away I tried talk
threw stones All village heard day
Marie position became worse ever The children would let
pass streets annoyed threw dirt
They used run racing away poor
feeble lungs panting gasping pelting shouting
abuse
Once I interfere force I took speaking
every day whenever I could Occasionally stopped
listened teased Marie
I told unhappy Marie stopped
abuse let go silently Little little got
way conversing together children I concealed nothing
I told They listened attentively soon
began sorry Marie At last took saying
kindly met It custom
salute anyone meet whether acquainted
I imagine astonished Marie first greetings
children
Once two little girls got hold food took
came back told They said burst tears
loved much Very soon became fond
Marie time began develop greatest affection
They often came begged tell stories I
think I must told stories well love hear
At last I took reading interesting things purpose pass
little ones went rest time
three years Later everyone even Schneider angry
hiding nothing children I pointed foolish
always knew things learnt way
soiled minds One remember one
childhood admit truth But nobody convinced It
two weeks mother died I kissed Marie
clergyman preached sermon children side
When I told shame parson talk

right village heard I caught
spoiling children Everyone discovered little ones
taken fond Marie parents terribly alarmed
Marie happy The children forbidden meet
used run village herd take food
things sometimes ran kissed said
vous aime Marie trotted back They imagined

I undeceive got enjoyment And
delicacy tenderness showed
In evening I used walk waterfall There spot
quite closed hidden view large trees
spot children used come They could bear
dear Leon love poor girl without shoes feet
dressed rags tatters So would believe actually
clubbed together somehow bought shoes stockings
linen even dress I understand managed
together When I asked laughed
shouted little girls clapped hands kissed I
sometimes went see Marie secretly She become ill
could hardly walk She still went herd could help
herdsman longer She used sit stone near wait
almost motionless day till herd went home Her consumption
advanced weak used sit closed eyes
breathing heavily Her face thin skeleton sweat used
stand white brow large drops I always found sitting
like I used come quietly look Marie
would hear open eyes tremble violently kissed
hands I take hand away made happy
would sit cry quietly Sometimes tried speak
difficult understand She almost like madwoman
excitement ecstasy whenever I came Occasionally children
came would stand way keep
guard us tell anybody came near This great
pleasure
When left Marie used relapse old condition
sit closed eyes motionless limbs One day could
go remained home alone empty hut
children soon became aware fact nearly
visited day lay alone helpless miserable bed
For two days children looked village
people got know Marie really dying old women
came took turns sit look bit I
think began little sorry village last
events interfere children
account
Marie lay state uncomfortable delirium whole
coughed dreadfully The old women would let children stay
room collected outside window morning
moment shouted jour notre bonne Marie Marie
sooner caught sight heard became quite animated
spite old women would try sit nod
head smile thank The little ones used bring
nice things sweets eat could hardly touch anything
Thanks I assure girl died almost perfectly happy She
almost forgot misery seemed accept love sort
symbol pardon offence though never ceased consider
dreadful sinner They used flutter window like
little birds calling aimons Marie
She died soon I thought would live much longer The
day death I went see last time
sunset I think recognized pressed hand
Next morning came told Marie dead The children
could restrained went covered coffin
flowers put wreath lovely blossoms head The pastor
throw shameful words poor dead woman
people funeral However came carrying
coffin children rushed carry Of course
could alone insisted helping walked
alongside behind crying
They planted roses round grave every year look
flowers make Marie beautiful
I ill odour parents children
especially parson schoolmaster Schneider obliged
promise I meet talk
conversed distance signs used write sweet
little notes Afterwards I came closer ever little souls
even dear fond
Schneider said I children great harm pernicious
system nonsense And mean system
He said afterwards believed I child
I came away You form face adult said
regards soul character perhaps even intelligence
child completest sense word always
live I laughed much course nonsense
But fact I care among people
much prefer society children However kind people may I
never feel quite home always glad get back
little companions Now companions always children
I child young things attract
On one first days stay Switzerland I strolling
alone miserable I came upon children rushing noisily
school slates bags books games
laughter shouts soul went I stopped laughed
happily I watched little feet moving quickly Girls
boys laughing crying went home many found
time fight make peace weep play I forgot troubles
looking And three years I tried understand
men ever tormenting I lived life
child thought I never leave little village
indeed I far thinking I ever return Russia
But last I recognized fact Schneider could keep
longer And something important happened Schneider
urged depart I going see get good advice
Perhaps lot life changed
principal thing The principal thing entire change
already come I left many things behind many They
gone On journey I said I going world
men I know much perhaps new life begun I
made mind honest steadfast accomplishing task
Perhaps I shall meet troubles many disappointments I
made mind polite sincere everyone
asked People may consider child like I often
called idiot one time I certainly ill I
nearly bad idiot I idiot How I possibly
I know I considered one
When I received letter dear little souls passing
Berlin I realized much I loved It
painful getting first little letter How melancholy
saw For month talking
departure sorrowing waterfall evening
parted night would hug tight kiss
warmly far And every would turn
one one I alone give kiss hug
show love The whole flock went station
mile village every one
would stop throw arms round little girls
tears voices though tried hard cry As train
steamed station I saw standing platform
waving crying Hurrah till lost distance
I assure I came saw kind faces I
read faces well heart felt light first time since
moment parting I think I must one born
luck one often meet people one feels love
first sight faces yet sooner I step
railway carriage I happen upon
I know less shamefaced thing speak one feelings

bit ashamed shy I unsociable sort fellow shall
likely come see time think
worse It I value society

saying know feelings children And
suppose I candid pure simplicity soul Oh dear
means case Perhaps I profound object
view
VII
When prince ceased speaking gazing merrily even
Aglaya Lizabetha Prokofievna looked jolliest
Well cried put paces

patronize young gentleman like poor picked
somewhere taken magnificent protection What fools
specially big fool father Well done prince I
assure general actually asked put paces

Most wonderfully said latter warmly gazing Aglaya
admiration Almost lovely Nastasia Philipovna quite
different type
All present exchanged looks surprise
As lovely said Epanchin As Philipovna
Where seen Nastasia Philipovna What Nastasia Philipovna
Gavrila Ardalionovitch showed general portrait
How Did bring portrait husband

prince left room
He indeed said Alexandra almost laughably times
Neither one seemed give expression full
thoughts
He got neatly faces though said Aglaya He
flattered us round even mamma
Nonsense cried latter He flatter It I found
appreciation flattering I think great deal foolish
He simple course also knowing Just like
How stupid speak portrait thought prince
entered study feeling guilt heart yet
perhaps I right He idea unformed yet
strange idea
Gavrila Ardalionovitch still sitting study buried
mass papers He looked though take salary
public company whose servant sinecure
He grew wroth confused prince asked portrait
explained came spoken
Oh curse said earth must go blabbing
You know nothing thing yet idiot added muttering
last word irrepressible rage
I sorry I thinking time I merely said
Aglaya almost beautiful Nastasia Philipovna
Gania asked details prince repeated
conversation Gania looked ironical contempt
Nastasia Philipovna began paused clearly much
agitated annoyed The prince reminded portrait
Listen prince said Gania though idea struck I
wish ask great favour yet I really know
He paused trying make mind something
turning matter The prince waited quietly Once Gania
fixed intent questioning eyes
Prince began rather angry
owing circumstance I need explain I care
go present without invitation I particularly wish speak
Aglaya I written words case I shall
chance seeing prince observed small note

Gania evidently much alarmed idea prince would
consent take note looked expression
absolute entreaty

The letter sealed continued Gania paused confusion
Oh I read said prince quite simply
He took portrait went room
Gania left alone clutched head hands
One word said one word I may yet
free
He could settle papers agitation
excitement began walking room corner
corner
The prince walked along musing He like commission
disliked idea Gania sending note Aglaya
two rooms distant
stopped though recalling something went window nearer
light began examine portrait hand
He longed solve mystery something face Nastasia
Philipovna something struck looked portrait
first time impression left It partly
fact marvellous beauty struck partly something
else There suggestion immense pride disdain face
almost hatred time something confiding full
simplicity The contrast aroused deep sympathy heart
looked lovely face The blinding loveliness almost
intolerable pale thin face flaming eyes strange
beauty
The prince gazed minute two glanced around
hurriedly raised portrait lips When minute
reached door face quite composed But
reached door met Aglaya coming alone
Gavrila Ardalionovitch begged give said handing
note
Aglaya stopped took letter gazed strangely prince
eyes There confusion face little surprise perhaps
By look seemed merely challenge prince
explanation Gania happened connected
matter But expression perfectly cool quiet even
condescending
So stood moment two confronting one another At length
faint smile passed face passed without word
Epanchin examined portrait Nastasia Philipovna
little holding critically arm length
Yes pretty said last even pretty I seen
twice distance So admire kind beauty
asked prince suddenly
Yes I kind
Do mean especially kind
Yes especially kind

though talking answering question
I think wandering little prince Epanchin decided
lengthened survey face tossed portrait

Aglaya merely glanced portrait frowned put
underlip went sat sofa folded hands Mrs
Epanchin rang bell
Ask Gavrila Ardalionovitch step way said man
answered
Mamma cried Alexandra significantly
I shall say two words said mother
silencing objection manner evidently seriously put
You see prince secrets us secrets
It seems etiquette house reason
Stupid nonsense matter ought approached
candour There marriage talked I
like marriage
Mamma saying said Alexandra hurriedly
Well dear girl As possibly like The
heart great thing rest rubbish though one must
sense well Perhaps sense really great thing Don smile
like Aglaya I contradict A fool heart

That I suppose I shameless creature cried Nastasia
Philipovna amused indifference Dear I came like fool

For moments Gania stood stunned struck lightning
sister speech But seeing Nastasia Philipovna really
leave room time sprang Varia seized
arm like madman
What done hissed glaring though would like
annihilate spot He quite beside could
hardly articulate words rage
What I done Where dragging
Do wish beg pardon creature come

A moments passed stood face face Gania still
holding wrist tightly Varia struggled twice get free
could restrain longer spat face
There girl cried Nastasia Philipovna Mr Ptitsin I
congratulate choice
Gania lost head Forgetful everything aimed blow Varia
would inevitably laid low suddenly another hand
caught Between Varia stood prince
Enough enough said latter insistence tremble
excitement
Are going cross path ever damn cried Gania
loosening hold Varia slapped prince face
force
Exclamations horror arose sides The prince grew pale
death gazed Gania eyes strange wild reproachful
look lips trembled vainly endeavoured form words
mouth twisted incongruous smile
Very well never mind I shall allow strike
said last quietly Then suddenly could bear
longer covering face hands turned wall
murmured broken accents
Oh ashamed afterwards

glance Gania left room
However reached outer hall turned round

hurriedly flushing red Then turned left

The prince left room shut chamber

eloquently pathetically subjects kinds interspersed
torrents recrimination members family He insisted

horror saw General Ivolgin quite familiar
house really seemed friends At every step named
topographical biographical detail left nothing

They stopped somewhat low doorway fourth floor Ardalion
Alexandrovitch evidently much countenance pushed Muishkin
front
I wait stammered I like surprise
Colia entered first door stood open mistress
house peeped The surprise general imagination fell
flat began address terms reproach
Marfa Borisovna forty years age She wore
feet slippers face painted
hair dozens small plaits No sooner catch sight
Ardalion Alexandrovitch screamed
There wicked mean wretch I knew My heart
misgave
The old man tried put good face affair
Come let us go right whispered prince ear
But serious wished think As soon visitors
crossed low dark hall entered narrow
furnished half dozen cane chairs two small
Madame Terentieff shrill tones habitual continued
stream invectives
Are ashamed Are ashamed You barbarian You tyrant
You robbed I possessed sucked bones
marrow How long shall I victim Shameless dishonourable man
Marfa Borisovna Marfa Borisovna Here Prince Muishkin
General Ivolgin Prince Muishkin stammered disconcerted old

But much general
Here roubles Marfa Borisovna I

friend I cruelly deceived Such life Now Excuse
I weak continued standing centre
room bowing sides I faint excuse Lenotchka
cushion dear
Lenotchka little girl eight ran fetch cushion
placed rickety old sofa The general meant said much
soon stretched turned face
wall slept sleep
With grave ceremonious air Marfa Borisovna motioned prince
chair one She seated opposite leaned
right cheek hand sat silence eyes fixed
Muishkin sighing deeply The three children two little
girls boy Lenotchka eldest came leant
table also stared steadily Presently Colia appeared
adjoining room
I glad indeed met Colia said prince
Can something I must see Nastasia Philipovna I
asked Ardalion Alexandrovitch take house
gone sleep see Will show way I
know street I address though close Grand
Theatre
Nastasia Philipovna She live tell truth
father never house It strange
depended She lives near Wladimir Street Five
Corners quite close Will go directly It
nine I show way pleasure
Colia prince went together Alas latter money
pay cab obliged walk
I liked taken see Hippolyte said Colia
He eldest son lady met next
room He ill bed day But rather strange
extremely sensitive I thought might upset considering
circumstances came Somehow touches less
concerns father mother That course makes
great difference What terrible disgrace woman
disgrace man least way Perhaps public opinion
wrong condemning one sex excusing Hippolyte
extremely clever boy prejudiced He really slave
opinions
Do say consumptive
Yes It really would happier die young If I
place I certainly long death He unhappy brother
sisters children saw If possible
little money leave respective families live together
little apartment It dream But know
I talking affair angry said
anyone call man given blow
coward He irritable I left arguing matter
So Nastasia Philipovna invited go see
To tell truth
Then come going cried Colia much
astonished stopped short middle pavement And
going At Home costume
I know really whether I shall allowed If
receive much better If matter ended As
clothes I
Are going particular reason way
getting society friends
No I really object going That I going business
difficult explain
Well whether go business affair I want
know The important thing eyes
going simply pleasure spending evening
company cocottes generals usurers If case I
despise laugh There terribly honest people
hardly one respect although people put airs Varia
especially Have noticed prince many adventurers
nowadays Especially dear Russia How happened I
never understand There used certain amount solidity
things happens Everything exposed public
gaze veils thrown back every wound probed careless fingers
We ever present orgy scandalous revelations Parents
blush remember morality At Moscow lately
father heard urging son stop nothing nothing mind
get money The press seized upon story course
public property Look father general See
yet I assure honest man Only drinks much
morals could desire Yes true I pity
tell truth I dare say everybody would
laugh I pity And really clever men
every one first last
Hippolyte finds excuses says necessity
He talks economic movement ebb flow capital
devil knows means It makes angry hear talk
soured troubles Just imagine general keeps
mother lends money She lends week ten days
high interest Isn disgusting And would hardly
believe mother Nina Alexandrovna helps Hippolyte
sorts ways sends money clothes She even goes far
helping children Hippolyte mother cares
nothing Varia
Well said honest good people
quite close
hand honest good people mother Varia I think
good deal moral strength helping people
circumstances
Varia pride likes showing giving
airs As mother I really admire yes honour
Hippolyte hardened feels He laughed first thought
vulgar sometimes quite touched overcome
kindness H You call strong good I remember
Gania knows nothing He would say encouraging
vice
Ah Gania knows nothing It seems many things
Gania know exclaimed prince considered Colia
last words
Do know I like much indeed prince I shall never forget
afternoon

The prince seemed quite distracted moment
You must tell tomorrow Don afraid I wish
success agree entirely I although I
understand cried Colia excitedly Now I
rush back tell Hippolyte plans proposals But
getting least afraid You see
She original everything It first floor The porter
show
XIII
The prince nervous reached outer door
best encourage reflection worst thing
could happen would would received perhaps
received laughed coming
But another question terrified considerably
going get And
question could fashion satisfactory reply
If could find opportunity coming close Nastasia
Philipovna saying Don ruin marrying man
He love loves money He told
Aglaya Ivanovna I come purpose warn
even seem quite legitimate practicable thing
Then another delicate question could
find answer dared fact think idea
trembled blushed However spite fears
went asked Nastasia Philipovna
Nastasia occupied distinctly tasteful flat
beautifully furnished arranged At one period five years
Petersburg life Totski certainly spared expenditure upon
He calculated upon eventual love tried tempt
lavish outlay upon comforts luxuries knowing well
easily heart accustoms comforts difficult
tear one self away luxuries become habitual
little little indispensable
Nastasia reject even loved comforts
luxuries strangely enough never became least degree
dependent upon always gave impression could
well without In fact went far inform Totski
several occasions case latter gentleman
considered unpleasant communication indeed
But late Totski observed many strange original features
characteristics Nastasia neither known reckoned
upon former times fascinated even
spite fact old calculations regard
long ago cast winds
A maid opened door prince Nastasia servants
females surprise received request announce
mistress without astonishment Neither dirty boots
hat sleeveless cloak evident confusion
manner produced least impression upon She helped
cloak begged wait moment
announced
The company assembled Nastasia Philipovna consisted none
intimate friends formed small party comparison
usual gatherings anniversary
In first place present Totski General Epanchin
They highly amiable appeared labouring
feeling anxiety result Nastasia
deliberations regard Gania result made public
evening
Then course Gania means amiable
elders stood apart gloomy miserable silent He
determined bring Varia Nastasia even asked
though sooner arrived reminded
episode prince The general heard
nothing began listen interest Gania
drily perfect candour went whole history
including fact apology prince He finished
declaring prince extraordinary man goodness
knows considered idiot hitherto far
one
Nastasia listened great interest conversation
soon turned Rogojin visit theme proved
greatest attraction Totski general
Ptitsin able afford particulars Rogojin conduct
since afternoon He declared busy finding money
latter ever since nine clock Rogojin declared
must absolutely hundred thousand roubles evening
He added Rogojin drunk course thought
money would forthcoming excited intoxicated rapture
fellow impelled give interest premium asked
several others engaged beating money
also
All news received company somewhat gloomy interest
Nastasia silent would say thought Gania
equally uncommunicative The general seemed anxious
decidedly uneasy The present pearls prepared
much joy morning accepted coldly Nastasia
smiled rather disagreeably took Ferdishenko
person present good spirits
Totski reputation capital talker
usually life soul entertainments silent
occasion sat state uncommon
perturbation
The rest guests old tutor schoolmaster goodness knows
invited young man timid shy silent rather
loud woman forty apparently actress pretty
German lady hardly said word evening
gift enlivening proceedings hardly knew
say addressed Under circumstances arrival
prince came almost godsend
The announcement name gave rise surprise
smiles especially became evident Nastasia astonished
look thought inviting But astonishment
Nastasia showed satisfaction prepared greet
prince cordial smiles welcome
Of course remarked General Epanchin pure
innocence It little dangerous perhaps encourage sort
freedom rather good thing arrived
moment He may enliven us little originalities
Especially asked said Ferdishenko
What got asked general loathed
Ferdishenko
Why must pay toll entrance explained latter
H Prince Muishkin Ferdishenko said general
impatiently This worthy gentleman could never quite reconcile
idea meeting Ferdishenko society equal footing
Oh general spare Ferdishenko replied smiling I
special privileges
What mean special privileges
Once I honour stating company I
repeat explanation excellency benefit You see
excellency world witty clever except I
neither As kind compensation I allowed tell truth
fact stupid people tell Added
I spiteful man I clever If I
offended injured I bear quite patiently man injuring
meets misfortune Then I remember take revenge I
return injury sevenfold Ivan Petrovitch Ptitsin says Of course
never Excellency doubt recollect Kryloff
fable The Lion Ass Well I That fable
written precisely us
You seem talking nonsense Ferdishenko growled
general
What matter excellency I know keep place When I
said I lion ass Kryloff
fable course understood I take role ass Your
excellency lion fable remarks
A mighty lion terror woods
Was shorn great prowess old age
And I excellency ass
I opinion last point said Ivan Fedorovitch
irritation
All doubt extremely coarse moreover
premeditated Ferdishenko persuaded everyone accept
buffoon
If I admitted tolerated said one day
simply I talk way How anyone possibly receive
man I I quite understand Now could I Ferdishenko
allowed sit shoulder shoulder clever man like Afanasy
Ivanovitch There one explanation one I given position
entirely inconceivable
But vulgarities seemed please Nastasia Philipovna although
often rude offensive Those wished go
house forced put Ferdishenko Possibly latter
mistaken imagining received simply order annoy
Totski disliked extremely Gania also often made butt
jester sarcasms used method keeping Nastasia
Philipovna good graces
The prince begin singing us fashionable ditty remarked
Ferdishenko looked mistress house see
would say
I think Ferdishenko please quiet answered Nastasia
Philipovna dryly
special patronage I withdraw claws
But Nastasia Philipovna risen advanced meet prince
I sorry forgotten ask come I saw
said I delighted able thank personally
express pleasure resolution
So saying gazed eyes longing see whether could make
guess explanation motive coming house
The prince would likely made reply kind words
dazzled appearance could speak
Nastasia noticed satisfaction She full dress
evening appearance certainly calculated impress
beholders She took hand led towards guests But
reached door prince stopped
hurriedly great agitation whispered
You altogether perfection even pallor thinness
perfect one could wish otherwise I wish come see
I forgive please
Don apologize said Nastasia laughing spoil whole
originality thing I think say must true
So think perfection
Yes
H Well may good reader riddles wrong
events I remind tonight
Nastasia introduced prince guests
already known
Totski immediately made amiable remark All seemed brighten
conversation became general Nastasia made prince sit
next
Dear nothing curious prince dropping
remarked Ferdishenko
It quite clear case said hitherto silent Gania I
watched prince almost day ever since moment first
saw Nastasia Philipovna portrait General Epanchin I remember
thinking time I pretty sure I may say
passing prince confessed
Gania said perfectly seriously without slightest
appearance joking indeed seemed strangely gloomy
I confess anything said prince blushing I
answered question
Bravo That frank rate shouted Ferdishenko
general laughter
Oh prince prince I never thought said General
Epanchin And I imagined philosopher Oh silent fellows
Judging fact prince blushed innocent joke
like young girl I think must honourable man
harbour noblest intentions said old toothless schoolmaster
unexpectedly much opened mouth
This remark provoked general mirth old fellow laughed
loudest lot ended stupendous fit coughing
Nastasia Philipovna loved originality drollery kinds
apparently fond old man rang bell tea
stop coughing It ten clock
Gentlemen like little champagne asked I
ready cheer us ceremony
This invitation drink couched informal terms
came strangely Nastasia Philipovna Her usual entertainments
quite like style However
wine refused guest took glass excepting Gania drank
nothing
It extremely difficult account Nastasia strange condition
mind became evident moment none could
avoid noticing
She took glass vowed would empty three times
evening She hysterical laughed aloud every minute
apparent reason next moment relapsing gloom
thoughtfulness
Some guests suspected must ill concluded last
expecting something continued look watch
impatiently unceasingly absent strange
You seem little feverish tonight said actress
Yes I feel quite ill I obliged put shawl I feel
cold replied Nastasia She certainly grown pale every
tried suppress trembling limbs
Had better allow hostess retire asked Totski
general
Not gentlemen Your presence absolutely
necessary tonight said Nastasia significantly
As present aware evening certain
important decision taken words Nastasia Philipovna
appeared fraught much hidden interest The general Totski
exchanged looks Gania fidgeted convulsively chair
Let play game suggested actress
I know new delightful game added Ferdishenko
What asked actress
Well tried party people like
instance somebody proposed us without leaving
place table relate something It
something really honestly considered worst action
ever committed life But honest
chief point He allowed lie
What extraordinary idea said general
That beauty general
It funny notion said Totski yet quite natural
new way boasting
Perhaps fascinating
Why would game cry laugh said
actress
Did succeed asked Nastasia Philipovna Come let try let
try really quite jolly might let try
We may like original events
Yes said Ferdishenko good idea come along men begin
Of course one need tell story prefers disobliging We
must draw lots Throw slips paper gentlemen hat
prince shall draw turns It simple game
tell story worst action life It
simple anything I prompt anyone forgets rules
No one liked idea much Some smiled frowned objected
faintly wishing oppose Nastasia wishes new idea
seemed rather well received She still excited
hysterical state laughing convulsively nothing everything Her
eyes blazing cheeks showed two bright red spots
white The melancholy appearance guests seemed add
sarcastic humour perhaps cynicism cruelty
game proposed Ferdishenko pleased At events
attracted idea gradually guests came round side
thing original least might turn amusing And
supposing something one one speak ladies
asked timid silent young man
Why course say anything As
plenty sins score without need said
Ferdishenko
But I really know actions worst said
lively actress
Ladies exempted like
And know one lying And one lies whole
point game lost said Gania
Oh think delightful hear one friends lie Besides
afraid Gania everybody knows worst action
without need lying part Only think gentlemen
Ferdishenko grew quite enthusiastic think eyes

Nastasia smiling

Ardalionovitch said least suggestion falsehood takes
point game It seems sincerity hand
possible combined kind bad taste would
utterly place

Ferdishenko You remark gentlemen saying I

Nastasia smiled amiably evidently depression
irritability increasing every moment Totski dreadfully
alarmed hear promise revelation life
I like everyone else began general committed certain
altogether graceful actions speak course life
But strangest thing case I consider
little anecdote I give confession
worst bad It years since
happened yet I day recall circumstances
without sudden pang heart
It silly affair I ensign time You know
ensigns blood boiling water circumstances generally
penurious Well I servant Nikifor used everything
quarters economized managed even laid hands
anything could find belonging people order augment
household goods faithful honest fellow
I strict nature At time stationed
small town I quartered old widow house lieutenant
widow eighty years age She lived wretched little wooden
house even servant poor
Her relations died husband dead buried forty
years since niece lived bullied
three years ago dead quite alone
Well I precious dull especially childish
nothing got Eventually stole
fowl mine business mystery day could

delighted go old lady pleased departure
Well day two afterwards I returned drill Nikifor
says We oughtn left tureen old lady I
nothing serve soup
I asked came tureen left Nikifor
explained old lady refused give said
broken bowl must tureen place
declared I arranged matter
This baseness part course aroused young blood fever
heat I jumped away I flew
I arrived old woman house beside She sitting
corner alone leaning face hand I fell like
clap thunder You old wretch I yelled sort thing
real Russian style Well I began cursing strange
thing happened I looked stared back eyes
starting head say word She seemed

setting outside I know make I went away
Before I reached home I met summoned major

dying moment I pounced began abusing
This produced great effect upon I used dream poor old
woman nights I really superstitious two days I

age She children husband family friends relations
household busy cheerful surrounded smiling faces
suddenly gone left alone like solitary
fly like fly cursed burden age At last God calls
Himself At sunset lovely summer evening little old
woman passes away thought notice offers much food
reflection behold instead tears prayers start
last journey insults jeers young ensign
stands hands pockets making terrible row

time look back calmly I pity poor old thing less
I repeat I wonder I really

But I thought I felt weight upon
mind I never got quite rid impression I put couple

There I repeat I dare say I committed many grievous
sin day I help always looking back upon
worst action I ever perpetrated
H instead bad action excellency detailed one

anticipating revelation must connected somehow
Nastasia whole story pulled lace trimming
sleeve never glanced speaker Totski handsome

I often said
And Afanasy Ivanovitch heaved deep sigh
PART II
I
Two days strange conclusion Nastasia Philipovna birthday
party record concluded first part
story Prince Muishkin hurriedly left Petersburg Moscow
order see business connected receipt
unexpected fortune
It said reasons hurried departure
movements Moscow
prolonged absence Petersburg able give little
information
The prince away six months even
interested destiny able pick little news
True certain rumours reach friends
strange rare one contradicted last
Of course Epanchin family much interested movements
though time bid farewell departure
The general however opportunity seeing twice
since eventful evening spoken seriously
though seen prince I say told family nothing
circumstance In fact month departure
considered thing mention prince name
Epanchin household Only Epanchin commencement
period announced cruelly mistaken
prince day two added evidently alluding
mentioning name unalterable
characteristic mistaken people Then ten
days later passage arms one daughters
remarked sententiously We enough mistakes I shall
careful future However impossible avoid remarking
sense oppression household something
unspoken felt something strained All members family
wore frowning looks The general unusually busy family hardly
ever saw
As girls nothing said openly events probably
little private They proud damsels always
perfectly confidential even among But understood
thoroughly first word occasions often
first glance need much talking rule
One fact least would perfectly plain outsider
person spot prince made
considerable impression upon family spite fact
inside house short
time Of course analyzed impression might proved
nothing feeling curiosity might
undoubtedly
Little little rumours spread town became lost maze
uncertainty It said foolish young prince name unknown
suddenly come possession gigantic fortune married
French ballet dancer This contradicted rumour circulated
young merchant come enormous fortune
married great ballet dancer wedding drunken
young fool burned seventy thousand roubles candle pure
bravado
However rumours soon died circumstance certain
facts largely contributed For instance whole Rogojin troop
departed head Moscow This exactly
week dreadful orgy Ekaterinhof gardens Nastasia
Philipovna present It became known orgy
Nastasia Philipovna entirely disappeared since
traced Moscow exodus Rogojin band found
consistent report
There rumours current Gania circumstances soon
contradicted He fallen seriously ill illness
precluded appearance society even business
month As soon recovered however threw situation
public company General Epanchin direction
unknown reason post given another He never went
near Epanchins house exceedingly irritable
depressed
Varvara Ardalionovna married Ptitsin winter said
fact Gania retirement business ultimate cause
marriage since Gania unable support family
even required help
We may mention Gania longer mentioned Epanchin
household prince certain circumstance
connection fatal evening Nastasia house became known
general fact family next day This
fact Gania come home night refused go
bed He awaited prince return Ekaterinhof feverish
impatience
On latter arrival six morning Gania gone
room bringing singed packet money
insisted prince return Nastasia Philipovna without
delay It said Gania entered prince room came
anything friendly feelings condition despair
misery short conversation stayed
couple hours sobbing continuously bitterly whole
time They parted upon terms cordial friendship
The Epanchins heard well episode Nastasia
Philipovna It strange perhaps facts become
quickly fairly accurately known As far Gania concerned
might supposed news come Varvara
Ardalionovna suddenly become frequent visitor Epanchin
girls greatly mother surprise But though Varvara seen
fit reason make friends likely
would talked brother She plenty
pride spite fact thus acting seeking intimacy
people practically shown brother door She
Epanchin girls acquainted childhood although late
met rarely Even Varvara hardly ever appeared
would slip back way Lizabetha Prokofievna
disliked Varvara although great respect mother
much annoyed sudden intimacy put general
contrariness daughters always lookout
new way opposing Nevertheless Varvara continued
visits
A month Muishkin departure Epanchin received letter
old friend Princess Bielokonski lately left Moscow
letter put greatest good humour She divulge
contents either daughters general conduct
towards former became affectionate extreme She even made
sort confession unable understand
She actually relaxed towards general little
long disgraced though managed quarrel
next day yet soon came round general behaviour
concluded good news sort would
like could make mind disclose
However week later received another letter source
last resolved speak
She solemnly announced heard old Princess Bielokonski
given comforting news queer young prince
Her friend hunted found going well
He since called person upon making extremely
favourable impression princess received day since
introduced several good houses
The girls could see mother concealed great deal
left large pieces letter reading
However ice broken suddenly became possible mention
prince name And became evident strong
impression young man made household one visit
Epanchin surprised effect news
Moscow upon girls less surprised
solemnly remarking striking characteristic
mistaken people troubled obtain prince
favour protection powerful old lady Princess
Bielokonski As soon ice thus broken general lost
time showing took greatest interest subject
He admitted interested said merely
business side question It appeared interests
prince made arrangements Moscow careful watch
kept upon prince business affairs especially upon Salaskin
All said prince undoubted heir
fortune turned perfectly true fortune proved
much smaller first reported The estate considerably
encumbered debts creditors turned sides prince
spite advice entreaty insisted upon managing matters
claim course meant satisfying everybody
round although half claims absolutely fraudulent
Epanchin confirmed She said princess written
much effect added curing fool But
plain expression face strongly approved
particular young fool doings In conclusion general observed
wife took great interest prince though
son commenced especially affectionate
towards Aglaya fact
All caused general look grave important But alas
agreeable state affairs soon changed
A couple weeks went suddenly general wife
gloomy silent ice firm ever The fact
general heard first Nastasia Philipovna fled
Moscow discovered Rogojin
disappeared found Rogojin
almost promised marry received news
disappeared almost day fixed wedding
flying somewhere interior Russia time
Prince Muishkin left affairs hands Salaskin
disappeared also whether Nastasia set
search unknown
Lizabetha Prokofievna received confirmatory news princess
alas two months prince first departure Petersburg
darkness mystery enveloped whereabouts actions
Epanchin family ice silence formed
subject Varia however informed girls happened
received news Ptitsin generally knew
people
To make end may say many changes Epanchin
household spring difficult forget
prince sent news
The Epanchin family last made minds spend summer
abroad except general could waste time travelling
enjoyment course This arrangement brought
persistence girls insisted never allowed
go abroad parents anxious marry
Perhaps parents last come conclusion husbands
might found abroad summer travel might bear fruit The
marriage Alexandra Totski broken Since
prince departure Petersburg said
subject dropped without ceremony much joy Mrs
General announced ready cross
hands gratitude escape The general however regretted
Totski long Such fortune sighed good
fellow
After time became known Totski married French marquise
carried Paris Brittany
Oh well thought general lost us good
So Epanchins prepared depart summer
But another circumstance occurred changed plans
intended journey put much delight
general spouse
A certain Prince S arrived Petersburg Moscow eminent

Prince S made acquaintance general family
Adelaida second girl made great impression upon Towards
spring proposed accepted The general

The trip abroad might enjoyed later Epanchin
two remaining daughters another circumstance
It happened Prince S introduced distant relation
Epanchin family one Evgenie Pavlovitch young officer
years age whose conquests among ladies
Moscow proverbial This young gentleman sooner set eyes
Aglaya became frequent visitor house He witty
extremely wealthy general soon
discovered His past reputation thing
Nothing said even hints dropped still
seemed better parents say nothing going abroad
season events Aglaya perhaps different
opinion
All happened second appearance hero upon
scene
By time judge appearances poor Prince Muishkin

subordinate I wished hear I say sent
message Peter Zakkaritch ask go private room They
tell expound prophecies relating Antichrist said
alone Is Yes I answered unhesitatingly
I began give comments Apostle allegorical vision At
first smiled reached numerical computations
correspondences trembled turned pale Then begged
close book sent away promising put name reward
list That took place I said eve Easter eight days
later soul returned God
What

child Peter Zakkaritch recalled interview said
foretold
The prince rose seat Lebedeff surprised see
guest preparing go soon remarked You interested
respectful tone

The prince seemed considering suggestion

Now precisely Lebedeff made mind
last three minutes Not difficulty finding tenant
fact house occupied present chance visitor
told Lebedeff would perhaps take summer months The
clerk knew well meant
thought could make tenant like prince felt
justified speaking vaguely present inhabitant intentions
This quite coincidence thought subject price
mentioned made gesture hand waive away
question little importance
Oh well like said Muishkin I think You shall
lose nothing
They walking slowly across garden
But I could stammered Lebedeff please
prince tell something subject would interest I
He spoke wheedling tones wriggled walked along
Muishkin stopped short
Daria Alexeyevna also villa Pavlofsk
Well
A certain person friendly intends visit
pretty often

Oh stop Lebedeff interposed Muishkin feeling
touched open wound That nothing I
like know going start The sooner better

The clerk stood looking guest struck sudden
He even remembered say goodbye
Lebedeff surprised omission knew
experience courteous prince usually
III
It close twelve clock
The prince knew called Epanchins would
find general latter might probably carry straight
Pavlofsk whereas one visit
anxious make without delay
So risk missing General Epanchin altogether thus
postponing visit Pavlofsk day least prince decided
go look house desired find
The visit pay respects risky one He
two minds knowing house Gorohovaya
far Sadovaya determined go direction
try make mind way
Arrived point Gorohovaya crosses Sadovaya
surprised find excessively agitated He idea
heart could beat painfully
One house Gorohovaya began attract attention long
reached prince remembered afterwards said
That house I sure He came quite
curious discover whether guessed right felt would
disagreeably impressed find actually done The
house large structure without slightest claim
architectural beauty colour dirty green There
old houses built towards end last century still
standing part Petersburg showing little change
original form colour They solidly built
remarkable thickness walls fewness
windows many covered gratings On
usually shop owner
lives Without well within houses seem inhospitable
mysterious impression difficult explain unless
something actual architectural style These houses
almost exclusively inhabited merchant class
Arrived gate prince looked legend
ran
House Rogojin hereditary honourable citizen
He hesitated longer opened glazed door bottom
outer stairs made way second storey The place
dark walls stone staircase painted
dull red Rogojin mother brother occupied whole
second floor The servant opened door Muishkin led
without taking name several rooms many
steps arrived door knocked
Parfen Rogojin opened door
On seeing prince became deadly white apparently fixed
ground like marble statue human The
prince expected surprise Rogojin evidently considered
visit impossible miraculous event He stared expression
almost terror lips twisted bewildered smile
Parfen perhaps visit I I go away
like said Muishkin last rather embarrassed
No right come said Parfen recollecting
They evidently quite familiar terms In Moscow many
occasions meeting indeed meetings
vividly impressed upon memories They met however
three months
The deathlike pallor sort slight convulsion lips
left Rogojin face Though welcomed guest still
obviously much disturbed As invited prince sit near
table latter happened turn towards startled
strange expression face A painful recollection flashed
mind He stood time looking straight Rogojin whose eyes
seemed blaze like fire At last Rogojin smiled though still
looked agitated shaken
What staring like muttered Sit
The prince took chair
Parfen said tell honestly know I coming
Petersburg
Oh I supposed coming replied smiling
sarcastically I right supposition see I
know would come
A certain strangeness impatience manner impressed prince
forcibly
And known I coming today irritated
asked quiet surprise
Why ask
Because I jumped train morning two eyes glared
moment since
Ha whose eyes may said Rogojin suspiciously It
seemed prince trembling
I know I thought hallucination I often
hallucinations nowadays I feel I five years ago
fits come
Well perhaps hallucination I know said Parfen
He tried give prince affectionate smile seemed
latter though smile something broken
could mend try would
Shall go abroad asked suddenly added Do
remember came train Pskoff together You

And Rogojin burst laughing time unconcealed malice
though glad able find opportunity
giving vent
Have quite taken quarters asked prince

furnished principally desks covered papers
books A wide sofa covered red morocco evidently served Rogojin
bed On table beside prince invited seat
lay books one containing marker reader
left volume Solovieff History Some
worn gilded frames hung walls impossible make
subjects represented blackened smoke age
One portrait attracted prince attention It showed
man fifty wearing long German cut He

walked along little I long wished ask

How strangely speak odd look said
involuntarily
I like looking picture muttered Rogojin noticing
apparently prince answered question
That picture That picture cried Muishkin struck sudden idea
Why man faith might ruined looking picture
So said Rogojin unexpectedly They reached front
door
The prince stopped
How said What mean I half joking took
quite seriously Why ask whether I believe God
Oh particular reason I meant ask many people
unbelievers nowadays especially Russians I told You ought
know lived abroad
Rogojin laughed bitterly said words opening door
held prince pass Muishkin looked surprised went
The followed far landing outer stairs
shut door behind They stood facing one another
though oblivious next
Well said prince holding hand
said Rogojin pressing hard quite mechanically
The prince made one step forward turned round
As faith said smiling evidently unwilling leave
Rogojin state faith I four curious conversations
two days week ago One morning I met man train
made acquaintance I often heard
learned man atheist I glad opportunity
conversing eminent clever person He believe
God talked good deal appeared
speaking And always struck
speaking men reading books
seem really touching though surface
may appear I told I dare say I
clearly express I meant could understand
That evening I stopped small provincial hotel

old friends tea together night
occupy bedroom They drunk one
noticed first time friend possessed silver watch
wearing chain He means thief
peasants go rich man watch fascinated could
restrain He took knife friend turned

Rogojin roared laughter He laughed though sort
fit It strange see laughing sombre mood
Oh I like That beats anything cried convulsively panting
breath One absolute unbeliever
believer murders friend tune
prayer Oh prince prince good anything You
invented It best thing I heard
Next morning I went stroll town continued
prince soon Rogojin little quieter though laughter
still burst intervals soon observed
soldier staggering pavement He came said
Buy silver cross sir You shall fourpence real
I looked held cross taken
neck evidently large tin one made Byzantine pattern I
fished fourpence put cross neck I could see
face pleased could thought
succeeded cheating foolish gentleman away went
drink value cross At time everything I saw made
tremendous impression upon I understood nothing Russia
vague fantastic memories So I thought
I wait awhile I condemn Judas Only God knows may
hidden hearts drunkards
Well I went homewards near hotel I came across poor woman
carrying child baby six weeks old The mother quite
girl The baby smiling first time
life moment I watched woman suddenly
crossed oh devoutly What good woman I asked

She simple mother true perhaps
knows may wife drunken soldier
Listen Parfen put question This reply
The essence religious feeling nothing reason
atheism crime acts kind nothing
things never There something besides something
arguments atheists never touch But principal
thing conclusion argument clearly

He turned went downstairs
Lef Nicolaievitch cried Parfen reached next
landing Have got cross bought soldier

A new fancy The prince reflected mounted stairs
He pulled cross without taking neck
Give said Parfen
Why
The prince would rather kept particular cross
I wear shall mine I take
You wish exchange crosses Very well Parfen case
I glad enough makes us brothers know
The prince took tin cross Parfen gold one exchange
made
Parfen silent With sad surprise prince observed look
distrust bitter ironical smile still altogether left
brother face At moments events showed
plainly
At last Rogojin took prince hand stood moments
though could make mind Then drew along
murmuring almost inaudibly
Come
They stopped landing rang bell door opposite
Parfen lodging
An old woman opened bowed low Parfen asked
questions hurriedly wait hear answer He led
prince several dark rooms spotlessly clean
white covers furniture
Without ceremony knocking Parfen entered small apartment
furnished like polished mahogany partition
dividing one half probably bedroom In one corner
room sat old woman close stove She
look old face pleasant round one
one could detect first glance quite
second childhood She wore black woollen dress black
handkerchief round neck shoulders white cap black
ribbons Her feet raised footstool Beside sat another old
woman also dressed mourning silently knitting stocking
evidently companion They looked though never broke
silence The first old woman soon saw Rogojin
prince smiled bowed courteously several times token
gratification visit
Mother said Rogojin kissing hand great friend
Prince Muishkin exchanged crosses like real brother
Moscow one time great deal Bless
mother would bless son Wait moment let arrange
hands
But old lady Parfen time touch raised right
hand three fingers held devoutly made sign
cross three times prince She nodded head kindly
There come along Lef Nicolaievitch I brought
said Rogojin
When reached stairs added
She understood nothing I said know I
wanted yet blessed shows wished
Well goodbye time went I must go
He opened door
Well let least embrace say goodbye strange fellow
cried prince looking gentle reproach Rogojin advancing
towards But latter hardly raised arms dropped
He could make mind turned away
prince order avoid looking He could embrace
Don afraid muttered indistinctly though I taken
cross I shall murder So saying laughed
suddenly strangely Then moment face became transfigured
grew deadly white lips trembled eyes burned like fire He
stretched arms held prince tightly said
strangled voice
Well take It Fate She I surrender Remember
Rogojin And pushing prince without looking back
hurriedly entered flat banged door
V
It late nearly two prince find
General Epanchin home He left card determined look
Colia room small hotel near Colia
informed might back shortly left word
three understood gone
Pavlofsk General Epanchin would dine The prince
decided wait till three ordered dinner At
three sign Colia The prince waited four
clock strolled mechanically wherever feet
carry
In early summer often magnificent days St
Petersburg bright hot still This happened day
For time prince wandered without aim object He
know town well He stopped look bridges
street corners He entered confectioner shop rest He
state nervous excitement perturbation noticed nothing
one felt craving solitude alone
thoughts emotions give passively He
loathed idea trying answer questions would rise
heart mind I blame thought
half unconsciously
Towards six clock found station
railway
He tired solitude new rush feeling took hold
flood light chased away gloom moment soul
He took ticket Pavlofsk determined get fast
could something stopped reality fantasy
inclined think He take place carriage
suddenly threw away ticket came disturbed
thoughtful A moments later street recalled something
bothered afternoon He caught engaged
strange occupation recollected taken odd
moments last hours looking around
something know He forgotten half
hour suddenly uneasy search recommenced
But hardly become conscious curious phenomenon
another recollection suddenly swam brain interesting
moment exceedingly He remembered last time
engaged looking around unknown something
standing cutler shop window exposed
certain goods sale He extremely anxious discover whether
shop goods really existed whether whole thing
hallucination
He felt curious condition today condition similar
preceded fits bygone years
He remembered times particularly absentminded
could discriminate objects persons unless
concentrated special attention upon
He remembered seeing something window marked sixty copecks
Therefore shop existed object really
window would prove able concentrate
attention article moment general rule
absence mind would great admit
concentration fact shortly left railway
station state agitation
So walked back looking shop heart beat
intolerable impatience Ah shop
article marked Of course sixty copecks thought
certainly worth This idea amused laughed
But hysterical laugh feeling terribly oppressed He
remembered clearly standing window
suddenly turned round earlier day turned
found dreadful eyes Rogojin fixed upon Convinced therefore
respect events delusion
left shop went
This must thought clear
hallucination station either something actually
happened occasions doubt But
loathing mental exertion overmastered would
think would put think something else
He remembered epileptic fits rather immediately
preceding always experienced moment two whole
heart mind body seemed wake vigour light
became filled joy hope anxieties seemed
swept away ever moments presentiments
one final second never second
fit came upon That second course inexpressible When
attack prince reflected symptoms used
say These moments short I feel
extreme consciousness consequently life
times due disease sudden rupture
normal conditions Therefore really higher kind life
This reasoning however seemed end paradox
lead consideration What matter though
disease abnormal tension brain I recall analyze
moment seems one harmony beauty
highest degree instant deepest sensation overflowing
unbounded joy rapture ecstatic devotion completest life
Vague though sounds perfectly comprehensible Muishkin
though knew feeble expression sensations
That indeed beauty harmony abnormal moments
really contained highest synthesis life could
doubt even admit possibility doubt He felt
analogous fantastic unreal dreams due intoxication
hashish opium wine Of could judge attack
These instants characterized define word
intense quickening sense personality Since last
conscious moment preceding attack could say
full understanding words I would give whole life
one instant doubtless really worth lifetime
For rest thought dialectical part argument little
worth saw clearly result ecstatic moments
stupefaction mental darkness idiocy No argument possible
point His conclusion estimate moment doubtless
contained error yet reality sensation troubled
What unanswerable fact And fact occurred The
prince confessed unreservedly feeling intense
beatitude crowded moment made moment worth lifetime I
feel said one day Rogojin Moscow I feel I
understood amazing words There shall And
added smile No doubt epileptic Mahomet refers
moment says visited dwellings Allah less
time needed empty pitcher Yes often
met Rogojin Moscow many subjects discussed He
told I brother thought prince He said
today first time
He sitting Summer Garden seat tree
mind dwelt matter It seven clock place
empty The stifling atmosphere foretold storm prince felt
certain charm contemplative mood possessed He found
pleasure gazing exterior objects around All
time trying forget thing escape idea
haunted melancholy thoughts came back though would
willingly escaped He remembered suddenly
talking waiter dined recently committed murder
whole town discussing thought something
strange came He seized violent desire
almost temptation strove vain
He jumped walked fast could towards Petersburg
One quarters St Petersburg He asked someone
little show Petersburg Side
banks Neva He gone however knew
well use go would certainly find
Lebedeff relation home He address must certainly
gone Pavlofsk Colia would let know If
go would merely curiosity sudden new idea
come head
However something move know going A
minute later still moving without knowing anything He
could longer think new idea He tried take interest
saw sky Neva He spoke children met
He felt epileptic condition becoming developed The
evening close thunder heard way
The prince haunted day face Lebedeff nephew
seen first time morning one haunted
times persistent musical refrain By curious association
ideas young man always appeared murderer Lebedeff
spoken introducing Muishkin Yes read something
murder quite recently Since came Russia
heard many stories kind interested His
conversation waiter hour ago chanced subject
murder Zemarins latter agreed
He thought waiter decided fool
steady intelligent man though said God knows
may really country one unfamiliar
difficult understand people one He beginning
passionate faith Russian soul however discoveries
made last six months unexpected discoveries But every
soul mystery depths mystery lie soul Russian
He intimate Rogojin example brotherly
friendship sprung yet really know
What chaos ugliness fills world times What
rascal nephew Lebedeff But I thinking continued
prince Can really committed crime Did
kill six persons I seem confusing things strange
My head goes round And Lebedeff daughter
sympathetic charming face held child arms
What innocent look laugh It curious I
forgotten I expect Lebedeff adores I really
believe I think sure two two make four
fond nephew
Well judge hastily Could really say
one short visit Even Lebedeff seemed enigma today
Did expect find He never seen like
Lebedeff Comtesse du Barry Good Heavens If Rogojin
really kill someone would rate senseless
chaotic affair A knife made special pattern six people killed
kind delirium But Rogojin also knife made special
pattern Can Rogojin wishes murder anyone The prince
began tremble violently It crime part imagine
anything base cynical His face reddened
shame thought came across flash
memory incidents Pavlofsk station
station morning question asked Rogojin
Rogojin cross even wearing
benediction Rogojin mother embrace darkened
staircase last supreme renunciation find full
new idea staring looking round
things base
Despair overmastered soul would go would go back
hotel even turned went way moment
changed mind went old direction
Why Petersburg Side already quite close
house Where idea He marching along without Yes
malady coming back clear enough gloom
heaviness ideas nothing less fit
coming perhaps would fit day
But gloom darkness fled heart felt full
joy hope thing doubt And yes
seen long really must see He wished could meet
Rogojin would take hand would go together His
heart pure rival Parfen Tomorrow would go
tell seen Why come sole
purpose seeing way Moscow Perhaps might
still knows She might gone away Pavlofsk yet
Yes must put straight must
passionate renouncements Rogojin It must clear
day Can Rogojin soul bear light He said love
sympathy pity true added pity greater
love quite fair Kin Rogojin
reading book sympathy beginning Did show

The prince flushed shame baseness How shall I

Rogojin The man moved stairs moment later

two I shall know thought
The staircase led first second corridors hotel along
lay guests bedrooms As often case Petersburg
houses narrow dark turned around massive stone

uncertainty longer turned head
The eyes two eyes met The man concealed niche
also taken step forward For one second stood face face
Suddenly prince caught man shoulder twisted round
towards light might see face clearly
Rogojin eyes flashed smile insanity distorted
countenance His right hand raised something glittered
The prince think trying stop All could remember
afterwards seemed called
Parfen I believe
Next moment something appeared burst open wonderful
inner light illuminated soul This lasted perhaps half second yet
distinctly remembered hearing beginning wail strange
dreadful wail burst lips accord
effort part could suppress
Next moment absolutely unconscious black darkness blotted
everything
He fallen epileptic fit
As well known fits occur instantaneously The face especially
eyes become terribly disfigured convulsions seize limbs
terrible cry breaks sufferer wail everything
human seems blotted impossible believe
man fallen emitted dreadful cry
It seems though inside stricken one
cried Many people borne witness impression many
behold epileptic fit without feeling mysterious terror
dread
Such feeling must suppose overtook Rogojin moment
saved prince life Not knowing fit seeing
victim disappear head foremost darkness hearing head
strike stone steps crash Rogojin rushed downstairs
skirting body flung headlong hotel like
raving madman
The prince body slipped convulsively steps till rested
bottom Very soon five minutes discovered

A pool blood steps near head gave rise grave fears Was

By time visitors disappeared
Ptitsin tactfully retreated Lebedeff wing Gania soon
followed
The latter behaved modestly dignity occasion
first meeting Epanchins since rupture Twice Mrs
Epanchin deliberately examined head foot

afford Aglaya good deal satisfaction
That Gavrila Ardalionovitch went

I glad said prince
He ill added Varia
How changed better asked Epanchin I see

So I said Adelaida solemnly
poor knight asked Epanchin looking round face
speakers turn Seeing however Aglaya blushing
added angrily
What nonsense talking What mean poor knight
It first time urchin favourite shown
impudence twisting people words said Aglaya haughtily
Every time Aglaya showed temper often
much childish pouting
apparent wrath impossible avoid smiling
unutterable indignation On occasions would say How
laugh
This time everyone laughed sisters Prince Prince
Muishkin though flushed reason Colia
Aglaya dreadfully indignant looked twice pretty
wrath
He always twisting round one says cried
I repeating exclamation said Colia A month ago
turning pages Don Quixote suddenly called
nothing better poor I know
referring course whether Don Quixote Evgenie
Pavlovitch someone else certainly said words
afterwards long conversation
You inclined go little far good boy
guesses said Epanchin show annoyance
But I alone cried Colia They talked
still Why Prince Adelaida Ivanovna declared
upheld poor knight evidently exist poor

Why I blame asked Adelaida smiling
You draw portrait us blame
Aglaya Ivanovna asked draw portrait gave whole
subject picture She invented
What I draw According lines quoted
From face never lifted
That eternal mask steel
What sort face I draw I draw mask
I know driving mask mean said
Epanchin irritably She began see pretty clearly though
meant referred generally accepted title
poor But specially annoyed prince
looking uncomfortable blushing like child
Well finished silly joke added I
told poor knight means solemn secret
approached lightly
But laughed
It simply Russian poem began Prince evidently
anxious change conversation strange thing without beginning
end poor A month ago
talking laughing looking subject one Adelaida
pictures know principal business family find
subjects Adelaida pictures Well happened upon poor
I remember thought first
Oh Aglaya Ivanovna said Colia
Very likely I recollect continued Prince S
Some us laughed subject liked declared
order make picture gentleman must first see
face We began think friends faces see
would none suited us matter stood
I know Nicolai Ardalionovitch brought
joke What appropriate funny quite lost
interest time
Probably new silliness said Epanchin
sarcastically
There silliness profoundest respect
said Aglaya seriously She quite recovered temper
fact certain signs fair conclude delighted
see joke going far careful observer might
remarked satisfaction dated moment fact
prince confusion became apparent
Profoundest respect What nonsense First insane giggling
sudden display profoundest Why respect Tell
suddenly developed profound respect

Because replied Aglaya gravely poem knight described
man capable living ideal life That sort
thing found every day among men times In
poem stated exactly ideal evidently
vision revelation pure Beauty knight wore round
neck instead scarf rosary A device N meaning
explained inscribed shield
No corrected Colia
I say shall cried Aglaya irritably Anyway
poor knight care lady He
chosen ideal bound serve break lances
acknowledge ideal pure Beauty whatever

actions
So ended Aglaya look difficult indeed judge
whether joking earnest
Pooh fool actions actions fool said
Epanchin young woman ought know better
At events talk like What poem
Recite I want hear poem I hated poetry life
Prince must excuse nonsense We neither us like sort
thing Be patient
They certainly put
The prince tried say something confused could
get words Aglaya taken liberties
little speech person present perhaps
least embarrassed She seemed fact quite pleased
She rose solemnly seat walked centre
terrace stood front prince chair All looked
surprise Prince sisters feelings decided
alarm see new frolic gone quite far
enough already thought But Aglaya evidently thoroughly enjoyed
affectation ceremony introducing
recitation poem
Epanchin wondering whether would forbid
performance moment Aglaya commenced
declamation two new guests talking loudly entered
street The new arrivals General Epanchin young man
Their entrance caused slight commotion
VII
The young fellow accompanying general tall
well built handsome clever face bright black eyes
full fun intelligence
Aglaya much glance new arrivals went
recitation gazing prince affected manner
alone It clear
special object
But new guests least somewhat eased strained
uncomfortable position Seeing approaching rose chair
nodding amicably general signed interrupt
recitation He got behind chair stood left
hand resting back Thanks change position
able listen ballad far less embarrassment
Epanchin also twice motioned new arrivals
quiet stay
The prince much interested young man entered He
easily concluded Evgenie Pavlovitch Radomski
already heard mention several times He puzzled however
young man plain clothes always heard Evgenie Pavlovitch
military man An ironical smile played Evgenie lips
recitation proceeding showed
probably secret poor knight joke But become
quite different matter Aglaya All affectation manner
displayed beginning disappeared ballad
proceeded She spoke lines serious exalted manner
much taste even seemed justify exaggerated
solemnity stepped forward It impossible
discern anything deep feeling spirit
poem undertaken interpret
Her eyes aglow inspiration slight tremor rapture
passed lovely features twice She continued recite
Once came vision glorious
Mystic dreadful wondrous fair
Burned spirit
And abode ever
Never sweet moment
Gazéd womankind
He dumb love wooing
And graces blind
Full love sweet vision
Brave pure took field
With blood stained letters
upon shield
Lumen caeli sancta Rosa
Shouting foe fell
And like thunder rang
O er cowering infidel
Then within distant castle
Home returned dreamed days
Silent sad death took
He mad legend says
When recalling afterwards prince could life
understand reconcile beautiful sincere pure nature
girl irony jest That jest
doubt whatever knew well enough good reason
conviction recitation ballad Aglaya
deliberately changed letters B He quite
sure done accident ears
deceived At events performance joke
course rather crude one premeditated They evidently
talked laughed poor knight month
Yet Aglaya brought letters without
slightest appearance irony even particular accentuation
even unbroken appearance seriousness assuredly
anyone might supposed initials original ones
written ballad The thing made uncomfortable impression upon
prince Of course Epanchin saw nothing either change
initials insinuation embodied therein General Epanchin
knew recitation verses going took
interest matter Of rest audience many understood
allusion wondered daring lady
motive underlying tried show sign feelings But
Evgenie Pavlovitch prince ready wager comprehended
tried best show comprehended smile
mocking leave doubt point
How beautiful cried Epanchin sincere admiration
Whose
Pushkin mama course Don disgrace us showing
ignorance said Adelaida
As soon reach home give read
I think copy Pushkin house
There couple torn volumes somewhere lying
time immemorial added Alexandra
Send Feodor Alexey first train buy copy
Aglaya come kiss dear recited beautifully
added whisper sincere I sorry If

Do understand Now come along young woman sat
long I speak another time
Meanwhile prince took opportunity greeting General Epanchin

The prince remarked Evgenie Pavlovitch plain clothes
evidently made great impression upon company present much
interests seemed effaced surprising
fact
His change dress evidently matter importance Adelaida
Alexandra poured stream questions Prince relative
young man appeared annoyed Ivan Fedorovitch quite excited
Aglaya alone interested She merely looked closely Evgenie
minute curious perhaps whether civil military clothes
became best turned away paid attention
costume Lizabetha Prokofievna asked questions clear
uneasy prince fancied Evgenie
good graces
He astonished said Ivan Fedorovitch I nearly fell
surprise I could hardly believe eyes I met Petersburg
Why haste That I want know He always said

Evgenie Pavlovitch remarked spoken intention
leaving service long ago He however always made less
joke one taken seriously For matter
joked everything friends never knew believe
especially wish understand
I retired time said laughing For months
year
But necessity retire complained
general far I know
I want go look country estates You advised
reply And I wish go abroad
After expostulations conversation drifted
channels prince attentive listener thought
excitement small matter curious There must
appears said
I see poor knight come scene said Evgenie
Pavlovitch stepping Aglaya side
To amazement prince overheard remark Aglaya looked
haughtily inquiringly questioner though would give
know could talk
poor knight understand question
But It late send town Pushkin It
much late I say Colia exclaiming loud voice I
told least hundred times
Yes really much late send town said Evgenie
Pavlovitch escaped Aglaya rapidly possible I
sure shops shut Petersburg past eight clock
added looking watch
We done without far interrupted Adelaida turn
Surely wait
Besides said Colia quite unusual almost improper
people position take interest literature Ask Evgenie
Pavlovitch I right It much fashionable drive

He gets conversation way laughed Evgenie
Pavlovitch He borrows whole phrases reviews I long
pleasure knowing Nicholai Ardalionovitch

red wheels But I exchanged rather behind
times Colia
The prince listening attentively Radomski words
thought manner pleasant When Colia chaffed
waggonette replied perfect equality friendly
fashion This pleased Muishkin
At moment Vera came Lizabetha Prokofievna carrying several
large beautifully bound books apparently quite new
What demanded lady

At moment Gania accompanied Ptitsin came terrace
From adjoining room came noise angry voices General
Ivolgin loud tones seemed trying shout Colia
rushed investigate cause uproar
This interesting observed Evgenie Pavlovitch
I expect knows thought prince
What son Pavlicheff And may son Pavlicheff
asked General Epanchin surprise looking curiously around
discovered alone clue mystery Expectation
suspense every face exception prince
stood gravely wondering affair entirely personal could
awakened lively widespread interest short time
Aglaya went peculiarly serious look
It well said put end affair

found among Nihilists go men action
The movement properly speaking derivative Nihilism though
known indirectly hearsay never advertise
doings papers They go straight point For
question showing Pushkin stupid Russia must

Another thought tormented He wondered arranged

Four persons entered led General Ivolgin state great

The prince begged visitors sit They young
made proceedings seem even extraordinary Ivan Fedorovitch

less abashed put air extreme In short
attitude one would expected men
professed despise trivialities foolish mundane conventions
indeed everything except personal interests
Antip Burdovsky stuttered son Pavlicheff
Vladimir Doktorenko said Lebedeff nephew briskly
certain pride boasted name
Keller murmured retired officer
Hippolyte Terentieff cried shrill voice
They sat row facing prince frowned played
caps All appeared ready speak yet silent

indignation
Leave Colia begged prince Exclamations arose sides
Let go reading costs ordered Lizabetha Prokofievna
evidently preserving composure desperate effort Prince
reading stopped I quarrel
Colia choice obey With crimson cheeks read
unsteadily
But young millionaire dwelt Empyrean
something new occurred One fine morning man called upon calm

disgusted cry indignation But Needless
say money returned rather flung back face The
case within province law must referred
tribunal public opinion guaranteeing
truth details related
When Colia finished reading handed paper prince
retired silently corner room hiding face
hands He overcome feeling inexpressible shame boyish
sensitiveness wounded beyond endurance It seemed
something extraordinary sudden catastrophe occurred
almost cause read article aloud
Yet others similarly affected The girls uncomfortable
ashamed Lizabetha Prokofievna restrained violent anger
great effort perhaps bitterly regretted interference
matter present kept silence The prince felt shy
people often case ashamed conduct
people humiliated guests dared look
face Ptitsin Varia Gania Lebedeff looked
rather confused Stranger still Hippolyte son Pavlicheff
also seemed slightly surprised Lebedeff nephew obviously

Burdovsky red lobster
The speech Lebedeff nephew caused certain stir among company
murmurs arose though exception Lebedeff still
much excited everyone careful interfere matter
Strangely enough Lebedeff although prince side seemed quite
proud nephew eloquence Gratified vanity visible
glances cast upon assembled company
In opinion Doktorenko said prince rather low
voice quite right least half say I would
go say altogether right I quite agree
something lacking speech I
undertake say precisely certainly omitted
something quite something
lacking But let us put aside return point Tell
induced publish article Every word calumny
I think gentlemen guilty mean action
Allow

What What What cried visitors violent
agitation
As article said Hippolyte croaking voice I told
already none us approve There writer
added pointing boxer sat beside I quite admit
written old regimental manner equal disregard
style decency I know cross fool
adventurer I make bones telling face every day
But half justified publicity lawful right
every man consequently Burdovsky excepted Let answer
blunders As objection I made name
presence friends I think I ought explain
gentlemen I assert rights though really
wished witnesses agreed unanimously upon point
came We care witnesses may
whether friends As fail recognize
Burdovsky right seeing mathematically demonstrable
well witnesses friends The truth
plainly evident
It quite true agreed upon point said Lebedeff
nephew confirmation
If case begin making fuss
asked astonished prince
The boxer dying get words owing doubt
presence ladies becoming quite jovial
As article prince said I admit I wrote spite
severe criticism poor friend I always overlook
many things unfortunate state health But I wrote
published form letter paper friend I showed
one Burdovsky I read even
He immediately gave permission publish admit
I might done without consent Publicity noble
beneficent universal right I hope prince
progressive deny
I deny nothing must confess article
Is bit thick mean Well way public
interest admit one
overlook blatant fact So much worse guilty parties
public welfare must come everything As certain
inaccuracies figures speech speak also admit
motive aim intention chief thing It
question making wholesome example individual case
examined afterwards style well thing
meant humorous speak everybody writes like
must admit Ha ha
But gentlemen I assure quite astray exclaimed
prince You published article upon supposition I
would never consent satisfy Burdovsky Acting conviction
tried intimidate publication revenged
supposed refusal But know intentions It may
I resolved satisfy Burdovsky claim I declare
openly presence witnesses I
The noble intelligent word intelligent noble man
last exclaimed boxer
Good God exclaimed Lizabetha Prokofievna involuntarily
This intolerable growled general
Allow gentlemen allow urged prince
I explain matters Five weeks ago I received visit
Tchebaroff agent Burdovsky You given flattering
description article Keller continued turning
boxer smile please I saw
Tchebaroff moving spirit matter speak
frankly I thought might induced Burdovsky make
claim taking advantage simplicity
You right I simple stammered Burdovsky much
agitated
You sort right suppose things said Lebedeff
nephew tone authority
It offensive shrieked Hippolyte insulting
suggestion false
I beg pardon gentlemen please excuse said prince I
thought absolute frankness sides would best
way I told Tchebaroff I Petersburg I would
commission friend look matter without delay I
would let know Burdovsky Gentlemen I hesitation
telling fact Tchebaroff intervention made
suspect fraud Oh take offence words gentlemen
Heaven sake touchy cried prince seeing
Burdovsky getting excited rest preparing
protest If I say I suspected fraud nothing personal
I never seen I even know names
I judged Tchebaroff I speaking quite generally
knew I done since I came fortune
You shockingly naive prince said Lebedeff nephew mocking
tones
Besides though prince millionaire even though
may really simple hardly outside
general law Hippolyte declared loudly
Perhaps possible prince agreed hastily though I
know general law allude I go please
take offence without good cause I assure I mean
offend least Really impossible speak three words
sincerely without flying rage At first I amazed
Tchebaroff told Pavlicheff son
miserable position Pavlicheff benefactor father
friend Oh Keller article impute things father
without slightest foundation He never squandered funds
company subordinates I absolutely certain
I imagine could bring write calumny
But assertions concerning Pavlicheff absolutely intolerable
You scruple make libertine noble man call
sensualist coolly speaking truth yet would
possible find chaster man He even scholar note
correspondence several celebrated scientists spent
large sums interests science As kind heart
good actions right indeed said I almost
idiot time could hardly understand anything I could
speak understand Russian though I appreciate I
remember
Excuse interrupted Hippolyte rather sentimental You
said wished come point please remember
nine clock
Very well gentlemen well replied prince At first I
received news mistrust I said I might
mistaken Pavlicheff might possibly son But I
absolutely amazed readiness son revealed
secret birth expense mother honour For
Tchebaroff already menaced publicity interview
What nonsense Lebedeff nephew interrupted violently
You right right cried Burdovsky
The son responsible misdeeds father
mother blame added Hippolyte warmth
That seems reason sparing said prince
timidly
Prince simple simplicity almost past
limit said Lebedeff nephew sarcastic smile
But right said Hippolyte strange tone
None none whatever agreed prince hastily I admit right
involuntary I immediately said
personal feelings nothing I thought right
satisfy demands Burdovsky respect memory
Pavlicheff I ought case whether I esteemed Mr
Burdovsky I mentioned gentlemen seemed
unnatural son betray mother secret way
In short convinced Tchebaroff must rogue
induced Burdovsky attempt fraud
But intolerable cried visitors starting
feet
Gentlemen I supposed poor Burdovsky must
man quite defenceless easy tool hands
rogues That I thought duty try help
Pavlicheff son first place rescuing
influence Tchebaroff secondly making friend I
resolved give ten thousand roubles sum
I calculate Pavlicheff must spent
What ten thousand cried Hippolyte
Well prince arithmetic much else mighty
clever though affect air simpleton said Lebedeff
nephew
I accept ten thousand roubles said Burdovsky
Accept Antip whispered boxer eagerly leaning past back
Hippolyte chair give friend piece advice Take
present see later
Look Muishkin shouted Hippolyte please understand
fools idiots guests seem imagine ladies
look upon us scorn especially fine gentleman
pointing Evgenie Pavlovitch I honour knowing
though I think I heard talk
Really really gentlemen cried prince great agitation
misunderstanding In first place Keller
greatly overestimated fortune article I far
millionaire I barely tenth suppose Secondly
treatment Switzerland far costing tens thousands
roubles Schneider received six hundred roubles year
paid first three years As pretty governesses
Pavlicheff supposed brought Paris exist
Keller imagination another calumny According
calculations sum spent considerably ten
thousand roubles I decided sum must admit
paying debt I could offer Burdovsky however kindly
disposed I might towards delicacy forbids I seem
offering charity instead rightful payment I know
see gentlemen Besides I intention leaving
matter I meant intervene amicably later help
improve poor Burdovsky position It clear
deceived would never agreed anything vile
scandalous revelations mother Keller article But
gentlemen getting angry Are never come
understanding Well event proved right I seen
eyes proof conjecture correct added
increasing eagerness
He meant calm hearers perceive words
increased irritation
What mean What convinced demanded angrily
In first place I opportunity getting correct
idea Burdovsky I see He innocent
man deceived everyone A defenceless victim deserves
indulgence Secondly Gavrila Ardalionovitch whose hands I
placed matter first interview barely hour ago
I heard time I away ill
three days since return Petersburg He tells
exposed designs Tchebaroff proof justifies
opinion I know gentlemen many people think idiot
Counting upon reputation man whose easily
loosened Tchebaroff thought would simple matter fleece
especially trading gratitude Pavlicheff But main
point listen gentlemen let finish main point Mr
Burdovsky Pavlicheff son Gavrila Ardalionovitch
told discovery assures positive
proofs Well think It scarcely credible even
tricks played upon Please note
positive proofs I hardly believe I assure I
yet believe I still doubtful Gavrila Ardalionovitch
time go details doubt
Tchebaroff rogue He deceived poor Burdovsky
gentlemen come forward nobly support
friend evidently needs support I quite see He abused
credulity involved attempted fraud
said done claim nothing else
What fraud What Pavlicheff son Impossible
These exclamations feebly expressed profound bewilderment
prince words plunged Burdovsky companions
Certainly fraud Since Burdovsky Pavlicheff son
claim neither less attempted fraud supposing
course known truth fact
deceived I insist point order justify I repeat
makes worthy pity stand
alone otherwise would behaved like scoundrel matter
But I feel certain understand I
I went Switzerland I stammered incoherently one tries
express oneself I understand I better
able pity Burdovsky I know experience
like I right speak Well though
person Pavlicheff son nothing humbug
yet I keep decision I prepared give ten
thousand roubles memory Pavlicheff Before Burdovsky made
claim I proposed found school money memory
benefactor I shall honour memory quite well giving
ten thousand roubles Burdovsky though
Pavlicheff son treated almost though That
gave rogue opportunity deceiving really
think Pavlicheff son Listen gentlemen matter must
settled keep calm get angry sit Gavrila
Ardalionovitch explain everything I confess
I anxious hear details He says
even Pskoff see mother Burdovsky
dead article read us makes Sit
gentlemen sit
The prince sat length prevailed upon Burdovsky company
likewise During last ten twenty minutes exasperated
continual interruptions raised voice spoken
great vehemence Now doubt bitterly regretted several words
expressions escaped excitement If
driven beyond limits endurance would ventured
express certain conjectures openly He sooner sat
heart torn sharp remorse Besides insulting Burdovsky
supposition made presence witnesses
suffering complaint treated
Switzerland reproached grossest indelicacy
offered ten thousand roubles everyone I ought
waited till offered money
alone thought Muishkin Now late mischief done
Yes I idiot absolute idiot said overcome
shame regret
Till Gavrila Ardalionovitch sat apart silence When
prince called upon came stood side calm
clear voice began render account mission confided
All conversation ceased instantly Everyone especially Burdovsky
party listened utmost curiosity
IX
You deny I sure said Gavrila Ardalionovitch turning
Burdovsky sat looking eyes perplexed
astonished You deny seriously born two
years mother legal marriage Burdovsky father
Nothing would easier prove date birth
facts look Keller version work
imagination one moreover extremely offensive
mother Of course distorted truth order strengthen
claim serve interests Keller said previously
consulted article paper read
whole Certainly could read passage
As matter fact I read interrupted boxer
contents given unimpeachable authority I
Excuse Keller interposed Gavrila Ardalionovitch Allow
speak I assure article shall mentioned proper place
explain everything moment I would rather
anticipate Quite accidentally help sister Varvara
Ardalionovna Ptitsin I obtained one intimate friends
Madame Zoubkoff letter written years ago
Nicolai Andreevitch Pavlicheff abroad After getting
communication lady I went advice Timofei
Fedorovitch Viazovkin retired colonel one Pavlicheff oldest
friends He gave two letters written latter
still foreign parts These three documents dates
facts mentioned prove undeniable manner
eighteen months birth Nicolai Andreevitch went abroad
remained three consecutive years Your mother
well aware never Russia It late read
letters I content state fact But desire come
tomorrow morning bring witnesses writing experts
I prove absolute truth story From moment
question decided
These words caused sensation among listeners
general movement relief Burdovsky got abruptly
If true said I deceived grossly deceived
Tchebaroff long time past long time I
wish experts I go see I believe I give
But I refuse ten thousand roubles
Wait five minutes Burdovsky said Gavrila Ardalionovitch
pleasantly I say Some rather curious important facts
come light absolutely necessary opinion
hear You regret I fancy whole
matter thoroughly cleared
Burdovsky silently resumed seat bent head though
profound thought His friend Lebedeff nephew risen
accompany also sat He seemed much disappointed though
ever Hippolyte looked dejected sulky well
surprised He attacked violent fit coughing
handkerchief stained blood The boxer looked
thoroughly frightened
Oh Antip cried miserable voice I say
day day yesterday perhaps really
Pavlicheff son
There sounds laughter
Now valuable piece information Keller replied
Gania However may I private information convinces
Burdovsky though doubtless aware date birth
knew nothing Pavlicheff sojourn abroad Indeed passed
greater part life Russia returning intervals
short visits The journey question unimportant
friends recollect twenty years course
Burdovsky could known nothing born
As event proved impossible find evidence
absence though I must confess chance helped quest
might well come nothing It really almost
impossible Burdovsky Tchebaroff discover facts even
entered heads try Naturally never dreamt
Here voice Hippolyte suddenly intervened
Allow Ivolgin said irritably What good
rigmarole Pardon All clear acknowledge
truth main point Why go tedious details You wish
perhaps boast cleverness investigation cry
talents detective Or perhaps intention excuse Burdovsky
proving took matter ignorance Well I consider
extremely impudent part You ought know Burdovsky
need excused justified anyone else It
insult The affair quite painful enough without Will
nothing make understand
Enough enough Terentieff interrupted Gania
Don excite seem ill I sorry I
almost done facts I must briefly refer
I convinced ought clearly explained
A movement impatience noticed audience resumed I
merely wish state information concerned
reason Pavlicheff interest mother Burdovsky
simply sister deeply
love youth certainly would married
sudden death I proofs circumstance almost
quite forgotten I may add mother ten years
old Pavlicheff took care gave good education
later considerable dowry His relations alarmed feared
might go far marry gave hand young
named Burdovsky reached age twenty I
even say definitely marriage affection After
wedding father gave occupation
wife dowry fifteen thousand roubles went commercial
speculations As experience cheated sides
took drink order forget troubles He shortened life
excesses eight years marriage died Your mother
says left direst poverty would
died starvation Pavlicheff generously
allowed yearly pension six hundred roubles Many people recall
extreme fondness little boy Your mother confirms
agrees others thinking loved
sickly child stammering speech almost
deformed known life Nicolai Andreevitch
partiality unfortunates every kind especially children In
opinion important I may add I discovered yet another
fact last I employed detective powers Seeing fond
Pavlicheff thanks went school
also advantage special teachers relations servants
grew believe son father
betrayed wife I may point idea accredited
generally last years Pavlicheff life
trembling succession earlier story
quite forgotten opportunity discovering truth
seemingly passed away No doubt Burdovsky heard
conjecture hesitate accept true I
honour making mother acquaintance I find knows
reports What know son
listened complaisantly I found respected
mother Pskoff ill deep poverty ever since
death benefactor She told tears gratitude
supported expects much believes fervently
future success
Oh unbearable said Lebedeff nephew impatiently What
good romancing
It revolting unseemly cried Hippolyte jumping fury
Burdovsky alone sat silent motionless
What good repeated Gavrila Ardalionovitch
pretended surprise Well firstly perhaps Burdovsky
quite convinced Pavlicheff love came simply
generosity soul paternal duty It necessary
impress fact upon mind considering approved
article written Keller I speak thus I look Mr
Burdovsky honourable man Secondly appears
intention cheating case even part Tchebaroff I
wish say quite plainly prince hinted
ago I thought attempt robbery extortion On
contrary everyone quite sincere matter although
Tchebaroff may somewhat rogue business acted
simply sharp lawyer would circumstances He looked
case might bring lot money
calculate badly one hand speculated generosity
prince gratitude late Pavlicheff
chivalrous ideas obligations honour
conscience As Burdovsky allowing principles may
acknowledge engaged business little personal
aim view At instigation Tchebaroff friends
decided make attempt service truth progress
humanity In short conclusion may drawn spite
appearances Burdovsky man irreproachable character
thus prince readily offer friendship
assistance spoke
Hush hush Gavrila Ardalionovitch cried Muishkin dismay
late
I said I repeated shouted Burdovsky
furiously I want money I take I
I going away
He rushing hurriedly terrace Lebedeff nephew seized
arms said something low voice Burdovsky turned
quickly drawing addressed unsealed envelope pocket
threw little table beside prince
There money How dare The money
Those two hundred fifty roubles dared send
charity hands Tchebaroff explained Doktorenko
The article newspaper put fifty cried Colia
I beg pardon said prince going Burdovsky I
done great wrong I send money charity
believe And I blame I offended The
prince much distressed seemed worn fatigue spoke
almost incoherently I spoke swindling I apply
I deceived I said afflicted like
But like give lessons support mother
I said dishonoured mother love She says
I know Gavrila Ardalionovitch tell
Forgive I dared offer ten thousand roubles I
wrong I ought done differently way
despise
I declare lunatic asylum cried Lizabetha Prokofievna
Of course lunatic asylum repeated Aglaya sharply
words overpowered voices Everybody talking loudly
making remarks comments discussed affair gravely others
laughed Ivan Fedorovitch Epanchin extremely indignant He stood
waiting wife air offended dignity Lebedeff nephew
took word
Well prince justice certainly know make
let us call infirmity sake politeness
set offering money friendship way
man could possibly accept This excess
ingenuousness malice ought know better anyone
word best fits case

misunderstanding
Never mind never mind said prince signing keep quiet
But mind said Lebedeff nephew vehemently Prince
never mind insult us We nothing hide actions
bear daylight It true hundred roubles
instead two hundred fifty
Why hardly remarked Gavrila Ardalionovitch
air ingenuous surprise
Don interrupt fools think Lawyer cried
Lebedeff nephew angrily Of course difference
hundred roubles two hundred fifty case
principle main point hundred fifty roubles
missing side issue The point emphasized
Burdovsky accept highness charity flings back
face scarcely matters hundred roubles two
hundred fifty Burdovsky refused ten thousand roubles
heard He would returned even hundred roubles
dishonest The hundred fifty roubles paid Tchebaroff
travelling expenses You may jeer stupidity
inexperience business matters done could already
make us look ridiculous dare call us dishonest The
four us club together every day repay hundred fifty
roubles prince pay instalments rouble

It reminds said Evgenie Pavlovitch laughing famous plea
certain lawyer lately defended man murdering six people
order rob He excused client score poverty
It quite natural said conclusion considering state
misery thought murdering six

Enough cried Lizabetha Prokofievna abruptly trembling anger
enough balderdash
In state terrible excitement threw back head flaming
eyes casting looks contempt defiance upon whole company
could longer distinguish friend foe She
restrained long felt forced vent rage

She flies rages sometimes said Ivan Fedorovitch
Prince next day often violent

Lizabetha Prokofievna
She scarcely descended terrace steps leading high road
skirts park Pavlofsk suddenly dashed smart
open carriage drawn pair beautiful white horses Having passed
ten yards beyond house carriage suddenly drew one
two ladies seated turned sharp round though
caught sight acquaintance particularly wished see

XI
The anger Epanchin family unappeased three days As usual
prince reproached expected punishment
inwardly convinced Lizabetha Prokofievna could seriously
angry probably angry He
painfully surprised therefore three days passed word
Other things also troubled perplexed one
grew important eyes days went He begun
blame two opposite tendencies one hand extreme
almost senseless confidence fellows vile
gloomy suspiciousness
By end third day incident eccentric lady
Evgenie Pavlovitch attained enormous mysterious proportions
mind He sorrowfully asked whether cause
new monstrosity refrained saying
else might fault As letters looked
harmless joke mere childish piece mischief childish
felt would shameful almost dishonourable attach
importance
The day scandalous events however prince
honour receiving visit Adelaida fiance Prince They
came ostensibly inquire health They wandered
walk called accident talked almost whole
time certain lovely tree
park Adelaida set heart upon picture This
little amiable conversation Prince part occupied time
word said last evening episodes At length Adelaida
burst laughing apologized explained come
incognito circumstance said nothing
prince either walking back coming see
later latter inferred Epanchin black
books Adelaida mentioned watercolour would much like show
explained would either send Colia bring
next day prince seemed suggestive
At length however visitors point departing
Prince seemed suddenly recollect Oh yes
said happen know dear Lef Nicolaievitch lady
called Evgenie Pavlovitch last night carriage
It Nastasia Philipovna said prince know I
tell companion
But earth mean I assure real riddle
others Prince seemed
influence sincere astonishment
She spoke bills Evgenie Pavlovitch said prince
simply Rogojin bought someone implied
Rogojin would press
Oh I heard much dear fellow But thing impossibly
absurd A man property like Evgenie give IOU
worried It ridiculous Besides
possibly intimate terms Nastasia Philipovna gave
us understand principal part mystery He given
word knows nothing whatever matter
course I believe Well question dear prince know
anything Has sort suspicion meaning come
across
No I know nothing whatever I assure I nothing
Oh prince strange become I assure I hardly know
old self How suppose I ever suggested
could finger business But quite
today I He embraced prince kissed
What mean though asked Muishkin business I
see particular business
Oh undoubtedly person wished somehow reason
Evgenie Pavlovitch bad turn attributing
witnesses qualities neither replied Prince
drily enough
Muiskhin looked disturbed continued gaze intently
questioningly Prince face The latter however remained
silent
Then simply matter bills Muishkin said last
impatience It said
But I ask dear sir anything common
Evgenie Pavlovitch Rogojin I tell man
immense wealth I know fact expectations
uncle Simply Nastasia Philipovna
Prince paused though unwilling continue talking Nastasia
Philipovna
Then events knows remarked prince moment
silence
Oh may He may known time ago two three
years least He used know Totski But impossible
intimacy She even
place many people even know returned Moscow I
observed carriage last three days
It lovely carriage said Adelaida
Yes beautiful certainly
The visitors left house however less friendly terms
But visit greatest importance prince
point view Admitting suspicions
moment occurrence last night perhaps even
Nastasia mysterious end view yet visit confirmed
suspicions justified fears It clear Prince S
wrong perhaps view matter somewhere near
truth right far understood
intrigue sort going Perhaps Prince saw
clearly allowed hearers understand At events
nothing could plainer Adelaida come
express purpose obtaining explanations suspected
concerned affair And must
terrible object view What There stopping
Muishkin knew experience performance anything
set mind Oh mad mad thought poor prince
But many puzzling occurrences day required
immediate explanation prince felt sad A visit Vera
Lebedeff distracted little She brought infant Lubotchka
usual talked cheerfully time Then came younger
sister later brother attended school close He
informed Muishkin father lately found new interpretation
star called wormwood fell upon
described Apocalypse He decided meant network
railroads spread face Europe present time The
prince refused believe Lebedeff could given
interpretation decided ask earliest
opportunity Vera related Keller taken abode
previous evening She thought would remain time
greatly pleased society General Ivolgin
whole family But declared come order
complete education The prince always enjoyed company
Lebedeff children today especially welcome Colia
appear day Early morning started Petersburg
Lebedeff also away business But Gavrila Ardalionovitch
promised visit Muishkin eagerly awaited coming
About seven evening soon dinner arrived At first
glance struck prince rate must know
details last night affair Indeed would impossible
remain ignorance considering intimate relationship
Varvara Ardalionovna Ptitsin But although
prince intimate sense although latter placed
Burdovsky affair hands mark
confidence received seemed curious many matters
tacitly avoided conversations Muishkin thought
Gania times appeared desire cordiality frankness
It apparent entered convinced
moment breaking ice come last
But Gania haste sister waiting
Lebedeff consult urgent matter business If
anticipated impatient questions impulsive confidences
soon undeceived The prince thoughtful reserved even little
asked none questions one particular
Gania expected So imitated prince demeanour talked
fast brilliantly upon subjects one
thoughts engaged Among things Gania told host
Nastasia Philipovna four days Pavlofsk
everyone talking already She staying Daria
Alexeyevna ugly little house Mattrossky Street drove
smartest carriage place A crowd followers
pursued first young old Some escorted
took air carriage
She capricious ever choice acquaintances
admitted narrow circle Yet already numerous
following many champions could depend time need
One gentleman holiday broken engagement
account old general quarrelled son
reason
She accompanied sometimes carriage girl sixteen
distant relative hostess This young lady sang well
fact music given kind notoriety little house
Nastasia however behaving great discretion whole She
dressed quietly though taste drive ladies
Pavlofsk mad envy well beauty
carriage horses
As yesterday episode continued Gania course
Here paused though expecting asked
knew But prince inquire Concerning Evgenie
Pavlovitch Gania stated without asked believed
former known Nastasia Philipovna past years
probably introduced somebody park
four days As question IOU spoken
might easily something though Evgenie undoubtedly
man wealth yet certain affairs equally undoubtedly
disorder Arrived interesting point Gania suddenly broke
said Nastasia prank previous evening
At last Varvara Ardalionovna came search brother remained
minutes Without Muishkin asking informed
Evgenie Pavlovitch spending day Petersburg perhaps would
remain tomorrow husband also gone town
probably connection Evgenie Pavlovitch affairs
Lizabetha Prokofievna really fiendish temper today
added went curious thing Aglaya
quarrelled whole family father mother
sisters also It good She said
quite casually though extremely important eyes
prince went brother Regarding episode
Pavlicheff son Gania absolutely silent partly kind
false modesty partly perhaps spare prince The
latter however thanked trouble taken
affair
Muishkin glad enough left alone He went garden
crossed road entered park He wished reflect
make mind certain This step one
things however thought rule decided
hastily without much reflection The fact felt
longing leave go away go anywhere
far enough without bidding farewell anyone He felt
presentiment remained days place
among people would fixed irrevocably permanently
However minutes decided run away
impossible would cowardly great problems lay
right leave unsolved least
refuse give energy strength attempt solve
Having come determination turned went home walk
lasted less quarter hour At moment
thoroughly unhappy
Lebedeff returned towards evening Keller managed
penetrate prince apartments He drunk
confidential talkative mood He announced come tell
story life Muishkin remained Pavlofsk
purpose There means turning nothing short
earthquake would removed
In manner one long hours began history
incoherent words jumped conclusion
ceased believe God Almighty lost every
vestige morality gone far commit Could
imagine thing said
Listen Keller returned prince If I place I
acknowledge unless absolutely necessary
reason But perhaps making worse
purposely
I tell one prince I name
help soul evolution When I die secret die
But excellency knew least idea
difficult get money nowadays Where find question
Ask loan answer always Give us gold jewels
diamonds quite Exactly one got Can
picture I got angry last said I
suppose would accept emeralds Certainly accept emeralds
pleasure Yes Well right said I Go devil
den thieves And I seized hat walked
Had emeralds asked prince
What I emeralds Oh prince simplicity
almost pastoral simplicity look upon life
Could something made man good influences asked
prince began feel kind pity visitor
He thought little value personal influence
sense humility peculiar way looking things
general Imperceptibly conversation grew animated
interesting neither two felt anxious bring
close Keller confessed apparent sincerity guilty
many acts nature astonished prince
could mention even At every fresh avowal professed
deepest repentance described bathed tears
prevent putting boastful air times
stories absurdly comical
prince laughed like madmen
One point favour seem mind
extreme truthfulness said prince last Do know
atones much
I assuredly chivalrous degree said Keller
much softened But know nobility mind exists
dream one may put It never appears practice deed Now
I never understand
Do despair I think may say without fear deceiving
given fairly exact account life I
least think would impossible add much
told
Impossible cried Keller almost pityingly Oh prince little
really seem understand human nature
Is really much added asked prince mild
surprise Well really want Speak tell
came make confession
What I want Well begin good meet man like
It pleasure talk faults I know
one best men
He hesitated appeared much embarrassed prince helped
Then wanted lend money
The words spoken grave tone even somewhat shyly
Keller started gave astonished look speaker thumped
table fist
Well prince enough knock It astounds Here
simple innocent knight golden age yet
yet read man soul like psychologist Now explain
prince I I really understand Of course
aim borrow money along asked question
nothing blameable thought quite
natural
Yes quite natural
And offended
Why I offended
Well listen prince I remained last evening partly
I great admiration French archbishop Bourdaloue I
enjoyed discussion till three clock morning
Lebedeff I swear I hold sacred I
telling truth I wished develop soul frank
heartfelt confession This thought I sobbing
sleep dawn Just I losing consciousness tears
soul tears face I remember I lay sobbing idea
hell struck Why confessing borrow money
You see confession kind masterstroke I intended use
means good grace favour I meant
walk hundred fifty roubles Now call
base
It hardly exact statement case said prince reply
You confused motives ideas I need scarcely say
often happens I assure Keller I reproach
bitterly sometimes When talking I seemed
listening something At times I imagined
men continued earnestly appeared much
interested conversation consoled certain
degree motive thing difficult fight
I tried I know God knows whence arise ideas
speak base I fear double motives ever
I judge opinion going far
give name baseness think You going
employ tears ruse order borrow money also
say fact sworn fact independently
confession made honourable motive As money
want drink After confession
weakness course anyone give bad habit
moment notice It impossible What It best I
think leave matter conscience How seem
As concluded prince looked curiously Keller evidently
problem double motives often considered
Well anybody call idiot I
understand cried boxer
The prince reddened slightly
Bourdaloue archbishop would spared man like
Keller continued judged humanity To show
grateful I punishment I accept hundred
fifty roubles Give enough I
really need fortnight least I ask
fortnight I like given Agatha present
really deserve Oh dear prince God bless
At moment Lebedeff appeared arrived Petersburg
He frowned saw rouble note Keller hand
latter got money went away Lebedeff began
abuse
You unjust I found sincerely repentant observed prince
listening time
What good repentance like It exactly
mine yesterday I said I base I base words nothing
Then words part I thought contrary
Well I mind telling truth Because see
man somehow Words actions truth falsehood
jumbled together yet I perfectly sincere I feel
deepest repentance believe choose words lies
come infernal craving get better people
It always notion cheating people using
repentant tears advantage I assure truth
prince I would tell man world He would laugh
jeer judge man humanely
Why Keller said thing nearly word word
minutes ago cried Muishkin And seem inclined boast
You astonish I think sincere
make regular trade Oh put pathetic expression
put hand heart Have anything say
You come nothing
Lebedeff grinned wriggled
I waiting day I want ask
question life please tell truth
Had anything affair carriage yesterday
Lebedeff began grin rubbed hands sneezed spoke
word reply

Lebedeff grimaced wriggled
Prince said Excellency You let tell whole
truth I tried explain I begun

The prince gave answer sat deep thought Evidently
struggling decide

PART III
I
The Epanchin family least serious members
sometimes grieved seemed unlike rest world
They quite certain times strong suspicion
things happen people Others led
quiet uneventful life subject continual upheavals
Others kept rails without difficulty ran
slightest obstacle Other houses governed timid routine
somehow different Perhaps Lizabetha Prokofievna alone
making fretful observations girls though wanting
intelligence still young general intelligent
narrow difficulty content say H leave
matter wife Consequently fell responsibility It
distinguished family particular
originality excursions track led breach
proprieties Oh
There nothing premeditated even conscious purpose
yet spite everything family although highly
respected quite every highly respected family ought
For long time Lizabetha Prokofievna mind
trouble owing unfortunate character
added distress She blamed stupid unconventional
Always restless always go constantly seemed
lose way get trouble simplest
ordinary affairs life
We said beginning story Epanchins liked
esteemed neighbours In spite humble origin Ivan
Fedorovitch received everywhere respect He deserved
partly account wealth position partly
though limited really good fellow But certain
limitation mind seems indispensable asset
public personages least serious financiers Added
manner modest unassuming knew silent yet
never allowed trampled upon Also
important advantage exalted
patronage
As Lizabetha Prokofievna reader knows belonged
aristocratic family True Russians think influential friends
birth She esteemed even loved
people consequence society whose example receiving
therefore followed others It seems hardly necessary remark
family worries anxieties little foundation
imagination increased absurd degree
wart forehead nose imagine world looking
people would make fun even
discovered America Doubtless Lizabetha Prokofievna considered
eccentric society none less esteemed pity
ceasing believe esteem When thought
daughters said sorrowfully hindrance
rather help future character temper
absurd ridiculous insupportable Naturally put blame
surroundings morning night quarrelling husband
children really loved point
even one might say passion
She distressed idea daughters might grow
eccentric like believed society girls
like They growing Nihilists repeated
For years tormented idea
question Why get married
It annoy mother one aim life
nothing else The fact piece modern ideas
wretched woman question Six months ago Aglaya took fancy
cut magnificent hair Why even I I young nothing
like The scissors hand I go knees
implore She I know sheer mischief spite
mother naughty capricious girl real spoiled child
spiteful mischievous degree And Alexandra wanted shave
head caprice mischief like little fool simply
Aglaya persuaded would sleep better without hair
suffer headache And many suitors
last five years Excellent offers What
want Why get married For reason vex
mother none none
But Lizabetha Prokofievna felt somewhat consoled could say
one girls Adelaida settled last It one
hands declared aloud though private expressed
greater tenderness The engagement happy suitable
therefore approved society Prince distinguished man
money future wife devoted could
desired Lizabetha Prokofievna felt less anxious
daughter however although considered artistic tastes
suspicious But make mother expressed
merry plenty It Aglaya future
disturbed With regard eldest daughter Alexandra
mother never quite knew whether cause anxiety
Sometimes felt nothing expected She
must fated old maid
beauty The mother spent whole nights weeping lamenting
time cause grief slumbered peacefully What
matter Is Nihilist simply fool
But Lizabetha Prokofievna knew perfectly well unnecessary
last question She set high value Alexandra Ivanovna judgment
often consulted difficulties wet
hen never moment doubted She calm nothing rouses
though wet hens always calm Oh I understand
Her eldest daughter inspired Lizabetha kind puzzled
compassion She feel Aglaya case though latter
idol It may said outbursts epithets
wet hen maternal solicitude usually showed
made Alexandra laugh Sometimes trivial thing annoyed Mrs
Epanchin drove frenzy For instance Alexandra Ivanovna
liked sleep late always dreaming though dreams
peculiarity innocent naive child seven
innocence dreams annoyed mother Once dreamt
nine hens cause quite serious quarrel
one knew Another time unusual dream
spark originality She dreamt monk dark room
frightened go Adelaida Aglaya rushed
shrieks laughter relate mother quite
angry said daughters fools
H stupid fool A veritable wet hen Nothing excites
yet happy days makes one miserable
look Why unhappy I wonder At times Lizabetha
Prokofievna put question husband usual spoke
threatening tone one demands immediate answer Ivan
Fedorovitch would frown shrug shoulders last give
opinion She needs husband
God forbid share ideas Ivan Fedorovitch wife
flashed back Or gross churlish
The general promptly made escape Lizabetha Prokofievna
grew calm That evening course would unusually
attentive gentle respectful gross churlish husband
dear kind Ivan Fedorovitch never left loving
She even still love He knew well
part held greatest esteem
But mother great continual anxiety Aglaya She exactly
like image everything said Epanchin A
tyrant A real little demon A Nihilist Eccentric senseless
mischievous Good Lord unhappy
But said fact Adelaida approaching marriage
balm mother For whole month forgot fears worries
Adelaida fate settled name Aglaya
linked society gossip People whispered Aglaya
good engaged Aglaya always looked sweet behaved
well period mother heart full joy Of
course Evgenie Pavlovitch must thoroughly studied first
final step taken really lovely dear Aglaya
become actually grew beautiful every day And Yes
abominable prince showed face everything went
everyone seemed mad March hares
What really happened
If family Epanchins nothing particular
would happened But thanks Epanchin invariable fussiness
anxiety could slightest hitch simplest
matters everyday life immediately foresaw dreadful
alarming consequences suffered accordingly
What must condition among imaginary
anxieties calamities constantly beset saw
looming ahead serious cause annoyance something really likely
arouse doubts suspicions
How dared write hateful anonymous letter
informing Aglaya communication Nastasia Philipovna
thought dragged prince along towards house
sat round table family
already assembled How dared much thing I
shame I thought particle truth
I show letter Aglaya Who dares play
jokes upon Epanchins go Yelagin instead
coming I better go Yelagin
summer Ivan Fedorovitch It fault I dare say
Varia sent letter It Ivan Fedorovitch woman
I know show make fool
used give pearls
But said mixed Your daughters mixed
Ivan Fedorovitch young ladies society young ladies
age married present heard everything
hear They mixed scene dreadful
youths You must pleased remember heard I
forgive wretched prince I never shall forgive And
please Aglaya attack nerves last three
days Why quarrelled sisters even
Alexandra respects much always kisses hands
though mother What riddles
guess What Gavrila Ardalionovitch Why
take upon champion morning burst tears
Why allusion cursed poor knight
anonymous letter And I rush like lunatic
drag back I believe I gone mad last What
earth I done To talk young man daughter
secrets secrets Thank goodness
idiot friend house Surely Aglaya fallen
love gaby What idea Pfu ought put
glass cases first shown curiosities
ten copecks peep
I shall never forgive Ivan Fedorovitch never Look
Why make fun She said would
Look She stares eyes
move yet told come He looks pale enough
abominable chatterbox Evgenie Pavlovitch monopolizes whole
conversation Nobody else get word I could soon find
everything I could change subject
The prince certainly pale He sat table seemed
feeling turns sensations alarm rapture
Oh frightened looking one side one particular
corner whence knew well pair dark eyes watching
intently happy think among
occasionally hearing voice although
written forbidden come
What earth say I wonder thought
He said word yet sat silent listened Evgenie
Pavlovitch eloquence The latter never appeared happy
excited evening The prince listened long
time take word said
Excepting Ivan Fedorovitch yet returned town
whole family present Prince intended
go hear band soon
Colia arrived presently joined circle So received
usual thought prince
The Epanchins charming building built
model Swiss chalet covered creepers It surrounded
sides flower garden family sat rule open
verandah prince house
The subject discussion appear popular
assembly would delighted change Evgenie
would stop holding forth prince arrival seemed spur
still oratorical efforts
Lizabetha Prokofievna frowned yet grasped subject
seemed arisen heated argument Aglaya sat apart
almost corner listening stubborn silence
Excuse continued Evgenie Pavlovitch hotly I say word
liberalism Liberalism sin necessary part
great whole whole would collapse fall pieces without
Liberalism much right exist moral
conservatism I attacking liberalism I attack
simple reason Russian liberal Russian liberal
liberal Show real Russian liberal I kiss
pleasure
If cared kiss said Alexandra whose cheeks
red irritation excitement
Look thought mother nothing
sleep eat year time suddenly flies
incomprehensible way
The prince observed Alexandra appeared angry Evgenie
spoke serious subject frivolous manner pretending
earnest irony
I saying came prince
nothing national liberalism nothing
liberals done least degree national They
drawn two classes old landowning class clerical
families
How nothing done Russian asked Prince S
It may Russian national Our liberals
Russian conservatives may sure nation
recognize anything done landed gentry
seminarists done either
Come good How maintain paradox If
serious I allow statement landed
proprietors pass unchallenged Why landed proprietor
cried Prince hotly
I suppose say nothing national literature
either said Alexandra
Well I great authority literary questions I
certainly hold Russian literature Russian except perhaps
Lomonosoff Pouschkin Gogol
In first place considerable admission second
place one peasant two
landed proprietors
Quite hurry For since part
three men three say something absolutely
borrowed fact three men become
really national If Russian shall done said anything really
absolutely original called national moment
though may able talk Russian language still
national Russian I consider axiom But speaking
literature began discussing socialists Very well
I insist exist one single Russian socialist There
never existed one socialists
derived two classes landed proprietors
seminarists All eminent socialists merely old liberals
class landed proprietors men liberals days
serfdom Why laugh Give books give studies
memoirs though I literary critic yet I prove
clear day every chapter every word writings
work former landed proprietor old school You
find raptures generous transports
proprietary woes tears proprietary
proprietary seminarist You laughing prince
smiling Don agree
It true enough everybody laughing prince among
I tell instant whether I agree
said latter suddenly stopping laughter starting like
schoolboy caught mischief But I assure I listening
extreme gratification
So saying almost panted agitation cold sweat stood upon
forehead These first words since entered house
tried lift eyes look around dared Evgenie
Pavlovitch noticed confusion smiled
I tell one fact ladies gentlemen continued
latter apparent seriousness even exaltation manner
suggestion chaff behind every word though
laughing sleeve nonsense fact discovery
I believe I may claim made alone At
events ever said written word
fact expressed whole essence Russian liberalism sort
I considering
In first place liberalism speaking generally
attack whether mistaken reasonable quite another question upon
existing order things Is Yes Very well Then fact
consists liberalism attack upon
existing order things attack upon essence things
indeed things attack
Russian order things Russia My Russian liberal
goes far reject Russia hates strikes
mother Every misfortune mishap fills
mirth even ecstasy He hates national customs Russian
history everything If justification
know believes hatred Russia
grandest profitable kind liberalism You often find
liberal applauded esteemed fellows
reality dreariest blindest dullest conservatives
aware fact This hatred Russia mistaken
Russian liberals sincere love country
boast see better neighbours real love one
country consist But late grown candid
ashamed expression love country annihilated
spirit words something injurious petty
undignified This truth I hold time
phenomenon repeated time
place therefore though I hold fact yet I recognize
accidental phenomenon may likely enough pass away
There thing anywhere else liberal really hates
country fact explained among By
original statement Russian liberal
liberal explanation I see
I take said joke said Prince seriously
I seen kinds liberals therefore set
judge said Alexandra I heard
said indignation You taken accidental case twisted
universal law unjust
Accidental case said Evgenie Pavlovitch Do consider
accidental case prince
I must also admit said prince I seen much
far question I help thinking
less right Russian liberalism phase
considering least really sometimes inclined hate
Russia existing order things general Of
course truth lay law
The prince blushed broke without finishing meant
say
In spite shyness agitation could help greatly
interested conversation A special characteristic
naive candour always listened arguments
interested answered questions put
subject issue In expression face naivete
unmistakably evident disbelief insincerity others
unsuspecting disregard irony humour words
But though Evgenie Pavlovitch put questions prince
purpose enjoy joke seriousness
yet answer surprised seriousness
looked gravely Muishkin though expected sort
answer
Why strange ejaculated You answer seriously
surely
Did ask question seriously inquired prince
amazement
Everybody laughed
Oh trust said Adelaida Evgenie Pavlovitch turns
everything everybody lay hold ridicule You hear
things says sometimes apparently perfect seriousness
In opinion conversation painful one throughout
ought never begun said Alexandra We going
walk
Come along said Evgenie glorious evening But prove
time I speaking absolutely seriously especially
prove prince prince interested
exceedingly I swear I quite ass
I like appear sometimes although I rather ass I admit
well ladies gentlemen allow put one
question prince pure curiosity It shall last
This question came mind couple hours since see
prince I think seriously times I made decision upon
I wish hear prince say
We used expression accidental This
significant phrase often hear Well long since everyone
talking reading terrible murder six people part
young fellow extraordinary speech counsel
defence observed condition
criminal must come head kill six
people I quote words sense
something like Now opinion barrister put
forward extraordinary plea probably absolutely convinced
stating liberal humane enlightened
view case could possibly brought forward days
Now distortion capacity perverted way viewing
things special accidental case general rule
Everyone laughed
A special case accidental course cried Alexandra Adelaida
Let remind Evgenie said Prince joke
getting little threadbare
What think prince asked Evgenie taking notice
last remark observing Muishkin serious eyes fixed upon
face What think special usual case rule
exception I confess I put question especially
No I think special case said prince quietly
firmly
My dear fellow cried Prince annoyance see
chaffing He simply laughing wants make
game
I thought Evgenie Pavlovitch talking seriously said prince
blushing dropping eyes
My dear prince continued Prince remember I
saying two three months ago We spoke fact newly
opened Law Courts one could already lay one finger upon many
talented remarkable young barristers How pleased
state things found glad I observe
delight We said matter proud clumsy
defence Evgenie mentions strange argument course
accidental case one thousand
The prince reflected little soon replied absolute
conviction tone though still spoke somewhat shyly
timidly
I wished say distortion Evgenie Pavlovitch
expressed met often far general rule
exception unfortunately Russia So much
distortion general rule perhaps dreadful crimes
would less frequent
Dreadful crimes But I assure crimes dreadful
probably horrible occurred times
times Russia everywhere else well And
opinion likely murders cease occur
long time come The difference former
times less publicity everyone talks writes
freely things fact gives impression
crimes sprung existence That mistake
lies extremely natural mistake I assure dear fellow said
Prince S
I know many terrible crimes
times Not long since I visited convict prison made
acquaintance criminals There even
dreadful criminals one speaking men
murdered dozen feel remorse
whatever But I especially noticed
hopeless remorseless murderer however hardened criminal may
still conscious
acted wickedly though may feel remorse whatever And
like Those Evgenie Pavlovitch spoken
admit criminals think right
even good deed perhaps
I consider greatest difference two cases
And recollect particular age
helplessly susceptible distortion ideas
Prince longer smiling gazed prince
bewilderment
Alexandra seemed wish put word prince
began sat silent though sudden thought caused
change mind speaking
Evgenie Pavlovitch gazed real surprise time
expression face mockery whatever
What looking surprised friend asked Mrs
Epanchin suddenly Did suppose stupider
incapable forming opinions
No Oh Not said Evgenie But prince
excuse question capable observing
seeing things evidently saw nothing
distorted perverted claim upon property
acknowledged day two since full arguments founded
upon distorted views right wrong
I tell friend cried Epanchin sudden
sitting imagining clever perhaps
laughing prince us meanwhile received
letter day claimant renounces claim
begs prince pardon There often get sort
letter yet ashamed walk noses air
And Hippolyte come stay said Colia suddenly
What arrived said prince starting
Yes I brought town left house
There It like cried Lizabetha Prokofievna boiling
entirely oblivious fact
taken prince part I dare swear went town
yesterday purpose get little wretch great honour

Hippolyte kissed hand twice thanked prince said
thought Hippolyte might feel better country
Don Colia use saying cried prince
rising taking hat

Never mind prince said Colia He right
taking nap journey He happy I think
perhaps would better let alone today
sensitive ill might embarrassed show
much attention first He decidedly better today says
felt well last six months coughed much
less
The prince observed Aglaya came corner approached
table point
He dare look conscious tips
fingers gazing perhaps angrily
probably flushed look fiery indignation black
eyes
It seems Colia foolish bring
young friend consumptive boy wept
profusely invited us funeral remarked Evgenie
Pavlovitch He talked eloquently blank wall outside
bedroom window I sure never support life without
I think said Epanchin quarrel

oblivious fact family start walk
park
Yes I remember boasted blank wall extraordinary
way continued Evgenie I feel without blank wall
never able die eloquently long die
eloquently
Oh must forgive blank wall said prince quietly He
come see trees poor fellow
Oh I forgive heart may tell like
laughed Evgenie
I think take quite like said prince
quietly without removing eyes carpet I think

Forgiving What I done need forgiveness
If understand course understand
He wished wished bless round
blessing died
My dear prince began Prince hurriedly exchanging glances
present easily find heaven earth
yet seem expect Heaven difficult thing find anywhere
prince far difficult appears good heart
Better stop conversation shall growing quite
disturbed minds
Let go hear band said Lizabetha Prokofievna angrily
rising place
The rest company followed example
II
The prince suddenly approached Evgenie Pavlovitch
Evgenie Pavlovitch said strange excitement seizing
latter hand assured I esteem generous
honourable man spite everything Be assured
Evgenie Pavlovitch fell back step astonishment For one moment
could restrain bursting laughing
looking closer observed prince seem quite

He seemed pause reply verdict looked
humbly around
All present stood rooted earth amazement unexpected

She appeared last stages wrath irritation eyes
flashed The prince stood dumbly blindly suddenly

Prokofievna trembling rage company general
Every one saying every one

So saying Aglaya burst bitter tears hiding face

She went talking chatting without pause occasional little
bursts laughter
Thank God thank God said Lizabetha Prokofievna without
quite knowing felt relieved
What extraordinary people thought Prince perhaps
hundredth time since entered intimate relations
family liked extraordinary people As
Prince Lef Nicolaievitch Prince seem quite like
somehow He decidedly preoccupied little disturbed
started
Evgenie Pavlovitch seemed lively humour He made Adelaida

mirth without giving explanation
The sisters also appeared high spirits never tired
glancing Aglaya prince walking front It
evident younger sister thorough puzzle
Prince tried hard get conversation Epanchin upon
outside subjects probably good intention distracting
amusing bored dreadfully She
degree answered cross purposes sometimes
But puzzle mystery Aglaya yet evening
The last exhibition fell lot prince alone When
proceeded hundred paces house Aglaya said
obstinately silent cavalier quick

eccentricities among people laughed talked among
Evgenie Pavlovitch found plenty friends bow
Several people noticed Aglaya prince still together
Before long two three young men come one two

tried get conversation Aglaya best secure
attention Aglaya behaved graciously chatted

indistinct nothing made The officer stared
intently glanced Evgenie divined latter
introduced gave undivided attention Aglaya Only
Evgenie Pavlovitch observed Aglaya flushed moment
The prince notice others talking making
agreeable Aglaya fact moments almost forgot
sitting At moments felt longing go away
somewhere alone thoughts feel one knew
Or impossible would like alone home
terrace without either Lebedeff children anyone else
lie think day night another day
He thought mountains especially certain spot
used frequent whence would look upon distant valleys
fields see waterfall far like little silver thread
old ruined castle distance Oh longed
alone thoughts think one thing life one

events answer But observing
others begun laugh opened mouth laughed
The laughter became general young officer seemed
particularly lively sort person simply shook mirth
Aglaya suddenly whispered angrily word
Idiot

It joke mamma joke like poor
knight nothing whatever I assure Alexandra whispered
ear She chaffing making fool
private fashion But carries little
far regular little actress How frightened us
lark

however daughter remark
The prince heard referred idiot shuddered
moment shudder happened caused
word applied The fact crowd far
sitting pale familiar face curly black hair
smile expression flashed across vision
moment disappeared Very likely imagined There
remained impression strange smile two eyes
bright green tie Whether man disappeared among crowd
whether turned towards Vauxhall prince could say
But moment two afterwards began glance keenly That
first vision might likely forerunner second
almost certain Surely forgotten possibility
meeting came Vauxhall True enough
remarked coming set Aglaya
condition remark anything
Had careful observe companion would seen
last quarter hour Aglaya also glancing
around apparent anxiety though expected see someone
something particular among crowd people Now moment
anxiety became marked excitement also increased visibly
looked
The reason anxiety soon became apparent From side
entrance Vauxhall near prince Epanchin
party seated suddenly appeared quite large knot

Heading little band walked three ladies two
remarkably lovely nothing surprising fact
large troop admirers following wake
But something appearance ladies
admirers peculiar quite different rest
public assembled around orchestra
Nearly everyone observed little band advancing pretended
see notice except young fellows exchanged
glances smiled saying something one another whispers
It impossible avoid noticing however reality

loudly however She dressed great taste
rather magnificence needed occasion perhaps
She walked past orchestra open carriage waiting
near road
The prince seen three months All days

mysterious presentiment restrained He could
picture impression meeting would make upon
though often tried imagine fear trembling
One fact quite certain meeting would
painful
Several times last six months recalled effect

painful impression
That month provinces seen woman nearly every
day affected deeply could look back upon
calmly In look woman something
tortured In conversation Rogojin attributed
sensation pity immeasurable pity truth The sight
portrait face alone filled heart full agony
real sympathy feeling sympathy nay actual
never left heart since hour still full
force Oh yes powerful ever
But prince satisfied said Rogojin Only
moment suddenly made appearance
realize full exact emotion called

And indeed words could expressed
horror yes fully convinced private
knowledge woman mad
If loving woman everything world least

Although impudence attack public proclamation
intimacy doubtless premeditated special
object yet Evgenie Pavlovitch first seemed intend make
show observing either tormentor words But Nastasia
communication struck force thunderclap On hearing
uncle death suddenly grew white sheet turned
towards informant
At moment Lizabetha Prokofievna rose swiftly seat
beckoned companions left place almost run
Only prince stopped behind moment though indecision
Evgenie Pavlovitch lingered collected
scattered wits But Epanchins time get
twenty paces away scandalous episode occurred The young officer
Evgenie Pavlovitch friend conversing Aglaya said
aloud great state indignation

spite mother sisters anxious cries come away
Prince ran persuaded last come home
Lizabetha Prokofievna saw returned state agitation
doubtful whether even heard calls But
couple minutes later reached park Aglaya suddenly
remarked usual calm indifferent voice
I wanted see farce would end
III
The occurrence Vauxhall filled mother daughters
something like horror In excitement Lizabetha Prokofievna
girls nearly running way home
In opinion much disclosed laid bare episode
spite chaotic condition mind able
feel less decided certain points
cloudy condition
However one party realized something important
happened perhaps fortunately enough something
hitherto enveloped obscurity begun
come forth little mists In spite Prince assurances
explanations Evgenie Pavlovitch real character position
last coming light He publicly convicted intimacy
So thought Lizabetha Prokofievna two elder
daughters
But real upshot business number riddles
solved augmented The two girls though rather irritated

Besides could help thinking sister Aglaya probably
knew whole matter mother put
together
Prince looked black night silent moody Mrs

In inexpressible agitation amounting almost fear prince slipped

wasting time case champagne time
like present
That prince almost fever truth He
wandered park long last came
lonely avenue He vaguely conscious already paced
particular walk large dark tree bench
end hundred yards altogether least thirty times backwards
forwards
As recollecting thinking time could
He caught however indulging one thought made
roar laughter though nothing really laugh
felt must laugh go laughing
It struck idea duel might occurred
Keller alone lesson art might
altogether accidental Pooh nonsense said
struck another thought sudden Why immensely
surprised find verandah laughed talked
And yet little note hand therefore must
known I sitting So surprised Ha ha
ha
He pulled note kissed paused reflected How
strange strange muttered melancholy enough In
moments great joy invariably felt sensation melancholy come
could tell
He looked intently around wondered come
tired approached bench sat Around
profound silence music Vauxhall The park
seemed quite empty though reality later
eleven It quiet warm clear night real Petersburg night
early June dense avenue sitting almost
pitch dark
If anyone come moment told love
passionately love would rejected idea astonishment
perhaps irritation And anyone added Aglaya
note contained appointment
lover rendezvous would blushed shame speaker
probably challenged duel
All would perfectly sincere part He never
moment entertained idea possibility girl loving
even thing falling love The
possibility loved man like put
ranked among ridiculous suppositions It appeared
simply joke Aglaya part really anything
seemed quite natural His preoccupation caused
something different
As words general let slip Aglaya laughing
everybody entirely believed He
feel slightest sensation offence contrary
quite certain
His whole thoughts next morning early would see
would sit little green bench listen
pistols loaded look He wanted nothing
The question might say special interest
occurred twice He doubt moment
really subject conversation store
little interested matter strike
wonder could The crunch gravel path suddenly
caused raise head
A man whose face difficult see gloom approached
bench sat beside The prince peered face
recognized livid features Rogojin
I knew wandering somewhere I look
long muttered latter teeth
It first time met since encounter staircase
hotel
Painfully surprised sudden apparition Rogojin
prince little unable collect thoughts
Rogojin evidently saw understood impression made
though seemed less confused first yet began talking
looked like assumed ease freedom However prince soon
changed mind score thought
affectation indifference Rogojin even particularly
agitated If little apparent awkwardness
words gestures The man could change heart
How find asked prince sake saying
something
Keller told I found place park
Of course I thought
Why asked prince uneasily
Rogojin smiled explain
I received letter Lef Nicolaievitch good
It use know I come bade
tell must see something say She
told find today

Why I I given Goodbye

What extraordinary man I wonder Rogojin laughed
sarcastically

brotherhood I wrote yesterday letter order
might forget madness part might feel
called talk met Why avoid Why
hold hand back I tell I consider

He moved pace two away hiding hands behind
No impossible come house added
slowly

letter use Of course I believe every word say
I know perfectly well neither ever deceive
way yet I love You write forgotten
everything remember brother Parfen
exchanged crosses remember anything
Rogojin aimed knife throat What know
feelings eh Rogojin laughed disagreeably Here holding
brotherly forgiveness thing I perhaps never
repented slightest degree I think
evening thoughts centred something else
Not think Of course cried prince And I
dare swear came straight away Pavlofsk listen
music dog crowd stare
today There nothing surprising If
condition mind could think nothing one subject
would probably never raised knife I
presentiment would day ever since I saw first
morning Do know looked like I knew
would try murder even moment exchanged
crosses What take mother Did think stay
hand Perhaps put thoughts words
I thinking thing feeling thing
looming us moment What think
raised knife knife God averted
throat I would guilty suspecting
would intended murder therefore
mutually guilty case Come frown laugh
either You say Repented You probably
try dislike much Why
I angel light innocent babe
would still loathe believed loved instead
loving That jealousy real jealousy
But know I thinking last week
Parfen I tell What loves better anyone And
torments loves proportion
love torments She tell
course must eyes see Why suppose consents
marry She must reason reason tell
day Some women desire kind love give
probably one Your love wild nature impress Do
know woman capable driving man crazy almost
cruelties mockeries feels one single pang regret
looks says There I torment
man nearly grave oh I compensate

Rogojin listened end burst laughing
Why prince I declare must taste sort thing
I heard tell something kind
know true
What What heard said prince stammering
Rogojin continued laugh loudly He listened prince
speech curiosity satisfaction The speaker impulsive
warmth surprised even comforted
Why I heard I see said When

among number bona fide unfortunates
He laughed
But trouble said prince slight pause
reflection goodness knows party break
Hadn better stroll park I excuse
danger going away
No I reasons wishing suspect us
engaged specially important conversation There gentry
present little much interested us You aware
perhaps prince It great deal better see
friendly ordinary way They go couple
hours I ask give twenty minutes half hour
By means I assure I delighted need entered
explanations As remarks friendship
thanks much indeed You must excuse little absent
evening Do know I somehow attentive anything
I see I see said Evgenie smiling gently His mirth seemed near
surface evening
What see said prince startled
I want suspect I simply come deceive
pump information said Evgenie still smiling
without making direct reply question
Oh I slightest doubt come pump
said prince laughing last I dare say
quite prepared deceive far goes But
I afraid besides hardly believe I feel
though I really care scrap one way
And capital fellow I convinced I
dare say really shall end good friends I like much
Evgenie Pavlovitch I consider good fellow indeed
Well case delightful man deal
business may concluded Evgenie Come along I
drink glass health I charmed entered alliance
added suddenly young Hippolyte come
stay
Yes
He going die I think
Why
Oh I know I half hour
Hippolyte waiting prince time never
ceased looking Evgenie Pavlovitch conversed
corner He became much excited approached table
He disturbed mind seemed perspiration stood large
drops forehead gleaming eyes easy read
impatience agitation gaze wandered face face
present object object room apparently without aim
He taken part animated one noisy conversation
company animation clearly outcome fever His
talk almost incoherent would break middle
sentence begun great interest forget
saying The prince discovered dismay Hippolyte
allowed drink two large glasses champagne one standing
third All found afterwards moment
notice anything particularly
Do know I specially glad today birthday cried
Hippolyte
Why
You soon see D know I feeling would lot
people tonight It first time presentiments
fulfilled I wish I known birthday I
brought present perhaps I got present Who knows
Ha ha How long daylight
Not couple hours said Ptitsin looking watch What
good daylight One read night open air without
said someone
The good Well I want see ray sun said
Hippolyte Can one drink sun health think prince
Oh I dare say one better calm lie
Hippolyte much important
You always preaching resting regular nurse
prince As soon sun begins resound sky poet
said The sun resounded It beautiful though
sense go bed Lebedeff tell
sun source life What source spring life
really mean Apocalypse You heard Star
called Wormwood prince
I heard Lebedeff explains railroads cover
Europe like net
Everybody laughed Lebedeff got abruptly
No Allow discussing cried waving
hand impose silence Allow With gentlemen
gentlemen added suddenly addressing prince certain
points He thumped table repeatedly laughter
increased Lebedeff usual evening condition
ended long scientific argument left excited
irritable On occasions apt evince supreme contempt
opponents
It right Half hour ago prince agreed among us
one interrupt one laugh person
express thoughts freely end everyone
spoken objections might made even atheists We chose
general president Now without rule order anyone might
shouted even loftiest profound thought
Go Go Nobody going interrupt cried several voices
Speak keep point
What star asked another
I idea replied General Ivolgin presided much
gravity
I love arguments prince said Keller also half
intoxicated moving restlessly chair Scientific political
Then turning suddenly towards Evgenie Pavlovitch seated near
Do know I simply adore reading accounts debates
English parliament Not discussions interest
I politician know delights see
address noble lord agrees honourable
opponent astonished Europe proposal noble viscount
sitting opposite expressions parliamentarism
free people enormous attraction It fascinates
prince I always artist depths soul I assure
Evgenie Pavlovitch
Do mean say cried Gania corner mean
say railways accursed inventions source
ruin humanity poison poured upon earth corrupt springs
life
Gavrila Ardalionovitch high spirits evening seemed
prince gaiety mingled triumph Of course
joking Lebedeff meaning egg grew excited
time
Not railways oh dear replied Lebedeff mixture
violent anger extreme enjoyment Considered alone railways
pollute springs life whole accursed
The whole tendency latest centuries scientific
materialistic aspect probably accursed
Is certainly accursed mean might That
important point said Evgenie Pavlovitch
It accursed certainly accursed replied clerk vehemently
Don go fast Lebedeff much milder morning said
Ptitsin smiling
But hand frank evening In evening
sincere frank repeated Lebedeff earnestly More candid
exact honest honourable although I may show
weak side I challenge atheists instance How
going save world How find straight road progress men
science industry cooperation trades unions
rest How going save I say By By credit What
credit To credit lead
You inquisitive remarked Evgenie Pavlovitch
Well anyone interest questions
opinion mere fashionable dummy
But lead least solidarity balance interests
said Ptitsin
You reach nothing help credit Without
recourse moral principle foundation
individual selfishness satisfaction material desires
Universal peace happiness mankind whole
result Is really I may understand sir
But universal necessity living drinking eating
short whole scientific conviction necessity
satisfied universal solidarity interests
seems strong enough idea serve basis speak
spring life humanity future centuries said Gavrila
Ardalionovitch thoroughly roused
The necessity eating drinking say solely
instinct
Is enough The instinct normal law
humanity
Who told broke Evgenie Pavlovitch
It law doubtless law neither less normal
destruction even Is possible
whole normal law humanity contained sentiment
Ah cried Hippolyte turning towards Evgenie Pavlovitch looking
queer sort curiosity
Then seeing Radomski laughing began laugh
nudged Colia sitting beside elbow
asked time He even pulled Colia silver watch
hand looked eagerly Then forgotten everything
stretched sofa put hands behind head
looked sky After minute two got came back
table listen Lebedeff outpourings latter
passionately commentated Evgenie Pavlovitch paradox
That artful traitorous idea A smart notion vociferated
clerk thrown apple discord But You
scoffer man world cavalry officer though without
brains realize profound thought true
Yes laws equally
powerful world The devil hold empire humanity
limit time still unknown You laugh You
believe devil Scepticism devil French idea
also frivolous idea Do know devil Do know
name Although know name make mockery
form following example Voltaire You sneer hoofs
tail horns produce imagination In
reality devil great terrible spirit neither
hoofs tail horns endowed
attributes But question
How know question cried Hippolyte laughing
hysterically
Another excellent idea worth considering replied Lebedeff But
question The question moment whether
weakened springs life extension
Of railways put Colia eagerly
Not railways properly speaking presumptuous youth general
tendency railways may considered outward expression
symbol We hurry push hustle good humanity
The world becoming noisy commercial groans solitary
thinker Undoubtedly noise waggons bearing bread
starving humanity value tranquillity soul replies
another triumphantly passes air pride As I
believe waggons bringing bread humanity For founded
moral principle may well even act carrying bread
humanity coldly exclude considerable portion humanity
enjoying seen
What waggons may coldly exclude repeated someone
That seen already continued Lebedeff deigning
notice interruption Malthus friend humanity
moral principles friend humanity devourer
humanity without mentioning pride touch vanity one
numberless philanthropists avenge
ready set fire whole globe tell truth
less like I perhaps might first set
light fuel run away But I must repeat
question
What goodness sake
He boring us
The question connected following anecdote past times
I obliged relate story In times country
I hope love much I far I concerned I
ready shed last drop blood
Go Go
In dear country indeed whole Europe famine visits
humanity four times century far I remember
every years I swear exact figure
anyhow become comparatively rare
Comparatively
To twelfth century immediately preceding following
We told historians widespread famines occurred
days every two three years condition things
men actually recourse cannibalism secret course One
cannibals reached good age declared free
course long miserable life
personally killed eaten profound secrecy sixty monks
mention several children number latter thought
six insignificant total compared enormous mass
ecclesiastics consumed As adults laymen say
never touched
The president joined general outcry
That impossible said aggrieved tone I often
discussing subjects nature gentlemen
part talks nonsense enough make one deaf story
pretence true
General remember siege Kars And gentlemen I assure
anecdote naked truth I may remark reality although
governed invariable law times resemblance falsehood
In fact truer thing less true sounds
But could anyone possibly eat sixty monks objected scoffing
listeners
It quite clear eat
space fifteen twenty years point view thing
comprehensible natural
Natural
And natural repeated Lebedeff pedantic obstinacy Besides
Catholic monk nature excessively curious would quite easy
therefore entice wood secret place false
pretences deal said But I dispute
least number persons consumed appears denote spice
greediness
It perhaps true gentlemen said prince quietly He
listening silence moment without taking part
conversation laughing heartily others time time
Evidently delighted see everybody amused
everybody talking even everybody drinking
It seemed intending speak suddenly
intervened serious voice everyone looked
interest
It true frequent famines time gentlemen
I often heard though I know much history But
seems must When I Switzerland I used
look astonishment many ruins feudal castles perched
top steep rocky heights half mile least
reach one climb many miles stony
tracks A castle know kind mountain stones
dreadful almost impossible labour Doubtless builders
poor men vassals pay heavy taxes keep
priesthood How could provide
time plough sow fields The greater number must
literally died starvation I sometimes asked
communities utterly swept face
earth could possibly survive Lebedeff mistaken
opinion says cannibals days
perhaps considerable numbers I understand
dragged monks means
It undoubtedly twelfth century monks
people one could eat fat among many lean said Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
A brilliant idea true cried Lebedeff never
even touched laity Sixty monks single layman It
terrible idea historic statistic indeed one
facts enables intelligent historian reconstruct
physiognomy special epoch brings point
mathematical accuracy clergy days sixty
times richer flourishing rest humanity perhaps
sixty times fatter also
You exaggerating exaggerating Lebedeff cried
hearers amid laughter
I admit historic thought conclusion
asked prince
He spoke seriously addressing Lebedeff tone contrasted
quite comically others They nearly laughing
notice
Don see lunatic prince whispered Evgenie Pavlovitch
ear Someone told bit touched
subject lawyers mania making speeches intends
pass examinations I expecting splendid burlesque
My conclusion vast replied Lebedeff voice like thunder Let
us examine first psychological legal position criminal
We see spite difficulty finding food
accused may say client often peculiar
life exhibited signs repentance wishing give
clerical diet Incontrovertible facts prove assertion He eaten
five six children relatively insignificant number doubt
remarkable enough another point view It manifest
pricked remorse client religious way
conscience I shall prove later desiring extenuate sin
far possible tried six times least substitute lay
nourishment clerical That merely experiment
hardly doubt question gastronomic variety
six would six Why thirty But
regard experiment inspired fear committing new
sacrilege number six becomes intelligible Six attempts
calm remorse pricking conscience would amply
suffice attempts could scarcely happy ones In
humble opinion child small I say sufficient
would result four five times lay children monks
required given time The sin lessened one hand would
therefore increased quantity quality Please
understand gentlemen reasoning thus I taking point
view might taken criminal middle ages As
man late nineteenth century I course
reason differently I say plainly therefore need jeer
mock gentlemen As general still
unbecoming part In second place giving personal
opinion child flesh satisfying diet insipid
sweet criminal making experiments could
satisfied neither conscience appetite I
conclude gentlemen conclusion contains reply one
important questions day This criminal ended
last denouncing clergy giving
justice We ask remembering penal system day
tortures awaited wheel stake fire
ask I repeat induced accuse
crime Why simply stop short number sixty keep
secret last breath Why could simply leave
monks alone go desert repent Or become
monk That puzzle comes There must
something stronger stake fire even habits
twenty years There must idea powerful
calamities sorrows world famine torture leprosy
plague idea entered heart directed enlarged
springs life made even hell supportable humanity
Show force power like century vices
railways I might say perhaps century steamboats
railways I repeat century vices railways I
drunk truthful Show single idea unites men nowadays
half strength centuries dare
maintain springs life polluted weakened
beneath star beneath network men entangled
Don talk prosperity riches rarity
famine rapidity means transport There riches
less force The idea uniting heart soul heart soul
exists All loose soft limp us limp
Enough gentlemen I done That question No
question excellency I believe sit banquet
provide us
Lebedeff roused great indignation auditors
remarked bottles constantly uncorked
speech unexpected conclusion calmed even turbulent
spirits That clever barrister makes good point said
speaking peroration later The visitors began laugh
chatter committee left seats stretched
legs terrace Keller alone still disgusted
Lebedeff speech turned one another saying loud
voice
He attacks education boasts fanaticism twelfth
century makes absurd grimaces added means
innocent makes How get money buy
house allow ask
In another corner general holding forth group hearers
among Ptitsin buttonholed I known said
real interpreter Apocalypse late Gregory Semeonovitch
Burmistroff pierced heart like fiery flash He began
putting spectacles opened large black book
white beard two medals breast recalling acts
charity added impressiveness He began stern voice
generals hard men world bowed ladies
fell ground fainting But one ends announcing
banquet That real thing
Ptitsin listened smiled turned get hat
intended leave changed mind Before others risen
table Gania suddenly left drinking pushed away
glass dark shadow seemed come face When
rose went sat Rogojin It might believed
quite friendly relations existed Rogojin also
seemed point going away sat motionless head bent
seeming forgotten intention He drunk wine
appeared absorbed reflection From time time raised eyes
examined everyone present one might imagined
expecting something important decided
wait The prince taken two three glasses champagne
seemed cheerful As rose noticed Evgenie Pavlovitch
remembering appointment made smiled pleasantly
Evgenie Pavlovitch made sign head towards Hippolyte
attentively watching The invalid fast asleep stretched
sofa
Tell prince earth boy intrude upon
asked annoyance irritation voice
prince quite surprised I mind laying odds
mischief
I observed said prince seems object
singular interest Evgenie Pavlovitch Why
You may add I surely enough think account
without therefore surprising I
tear eyes thoughts away detestable physiognomy
Oh come He handsome face
Why look look
The prince glanced Evgenie Pavlovitch considerable
surprise

Hippolyte fallen asleep Lebedeff discourse
suddenly woke though someone jogged side He
shuddered raised arm gazed around grew pale
A look almost terror crossed face recollected

Pavlovitch

MY NECESSARY EXPLANATION
moi le
Yesterday morning prince came see Among things
asked come villa I knew would come persuade
step would adduce argument would
easier die among people green trees expressed
But today say die said It pretty much
position says When I asked
made point green trees told astonishment
heard last time I Pavlofsk I said I
come last look trees
When I observed whether one died among trees
front blank brick wall worth
making fuss fortnight agreed But insisted
good air Pavlofsk greenness would certainly cause
physical change better excitement
would perhaps relieved I remarked smile
spoke like materialist answered always one
As never tells lie must something words His smile
pleasant one I good look I know whether
I like I time waste question The
hatred I felt five months become considerably
modified I may say last month Who knows perhaps I
going Pavlofsk purpose see But I leave chamber
Those sentenced death leave cells If I
formed final resolve decided wait last
minute I leave room accept invitation come
die Pavlofsk I must quick finish explanation
tomorrow I shall time read correct I
must read tomorrow prince two three witnesses I
shall probably find
As absolutely true without touch falsehood I
curious see impression make upon moment
I read This last solemn need I call
There question truth
worthwhile lying fortnight fortnight life
worth proof I write nothing pure truth
Let remember consider I mad moment
rather moments I told consumptives sometimes
go minds last stages malady
I prove tomorrow I read impression
makes upon audience I must settle question
otherwise I go anything
I believe I written dreadful nonsense time
correcting I said Besides I made
promise alter single word I write paper even
though I find I contradicting every five lines I wish
verify working natural logic ideas tomorrow
reading whether I capable detecting logical errors whether
I meditated last six months true
nothing delirium
If two months since I called upon leave room
view Meyer wall opposite I verily believe I
sorry But I feeling yet I leaving room
Meyer brick wall So conclusion
worth indulging grief emotion fortnight
proved stronger nature taken
direction feelings But Is case nature
conquered entirely If I put rack I
certainly cry I say worth yell
feel pain I fortnight live
But true I fortnight life left I know I
told friends Doctor informed
case I confess I lied even seen However
week ago I called medical student Kislorodoff
Nationalist Atheist Nihilist conviction
I I needed man would tell bare truth without
humbug ceremony indeed almost pleasure I
thought going little far
Well plumped I month left might
little said favourable circumstances might
also considerably less According opinion I might die quite
suddenly tomorrow instance cases Only day
two since young lady Colomna suffered consumption
par march disease going
market buy provisions suddenly felt faint lay
sofa gasped died
Kislorodoff told sort exaggerated
negligence though great honour talking
showed considered sort exalted
Nihilistic death matter
consequence whatever either way
At events fact remained month life That
right estimation I absolutely persuaded
It puzzles much think earth prince guessed yesterday
I bad dreams He said Your excitement dreams
find relief Why say dreams Either
doctor else man exceptional intelligence wonderful
powers observation But idiot bottom
doubt whatever It happened arrived I
delightful little dream one kind I hundreds
I fallen asleep hour came dreamed
I room It large room well
furnished cupboard chest drawers sofa bed fine
wide bed covered silken counterpane But I observed room
creature sort monster It little like
scorpion scorpion far horrible especially
creatures anything like nature
appeared purpose bore mysterious
signification I looked beast well brown colour
shell crawling kind reptile eight inches long
narrowed head couple fingers
width end tail came fine point Out
trunk couple inches head came two legs
angle degrees three inches long
beast looked like trident It eight hard
whiskers coming different parts body went along like
snake bending body spite shell wore
motion quick horrible look I dreadfully
afraid would sting somebody told I thought
venomous tormented wondering
wondering sent room mystery
I felt contained
It hid cupboard chest drawers
crawled corners I sat chair kept legs tucked
Then beast crawled quietly across room disappeared
somewhere near chair I looked terror I still
hoped feet safely tucked away would able
touch
Suddenly I heard behind level head sort
rattling sound I turned sharp round saw brute
crawled wall high level face
horrible tail moving incredibly fast side side
actually touching hair I jumped disappeared I
dare lie bed fear creep pillow My
mother came room friends They began hunt
reptile composed I seem
afraid But understand I
Suddenly monster reappeared crawled slowly across room
made door though fixed intention slow
movement horrible ever
Then mother opened door called dog Norma Norma
great Newfoundland died five years ago
She sprang forward stood still front reptile
turned stone The beast stopped tail
claws still moved I believe animals incapable feeling
supernatural fright I rightly informed
moment appeared something ordinary
Norma terror though must supernatural though
felt I reptile connected
mysterious secret fatal omen
Norma backed slowly carefully away brute followed
creeping deliberately though intended make
sudden dart sting
In spite Norma terror looked furious though trembled
limbs At length slowly bared terrible teeth opened
great red jaws hesitated took courage seized beast
mouth It seemed try dart jaws twice Norma caught
half swallowed escaping The shell cracked
teeth tail legs stuck mouth shook
horrible manner Suddenly Norma gave piteous whine reptile
bitten tongue She opened mouth wide pain I saw
beast lying across tongue body almost
bitten two came hideous substance oozing
Norma mouth consistency crushed Just
I awoke prince entered room
Gentlemen said Hippolyte breaking I done yet
seems I written great deal
unnecessary dream
You indeed said Gania
There much I know As Hippolyte said
face wore tired pained look wiped sweat brow
Yes said Lebedeff certainly think great deal much
Well gentlemen I force anyone listen If
unwilling sit please go away means
He turns people house muttered Rogojin
Suppose go away said Ferdishenko suddenly
Hippolyte clutched manuscript gazing last speaker
glittering eyes said You like A laughed
Hippolyte said prince give papers go bed like
sensible fellow We good talk tomorrow really
go reading good
How I How I cried Hippolyte looking amazement
Gentlemen I fool I break Listen everyone
wants
He gulped water glass standing near bent
table order hide face audience recommenced
The idea worth living weeks took
possession month ago I told I four weeks
live partially time The idea quite overmastered
three days since evening Pavlofsk The first time I felt
really impressed thought terrace prince
moment I taken head make last trial
life I wanted see people trees I believe I said
I got excited I maintained Burdovsky rights neighbour I
dreamt one would open arms embrace
would indescribable exchange forgiveness us
In word I behaved like fool instant I
felt last I ask I could waited six
months conviction I knew I disease spares
one I really illusions I realized
condition I clung life I wanted live price I
confess I might well resented blind deaf fate
apparent reason seemed decided crush like fly
I stop resentment Why I begin live knowing
worthwhile begin Why I attempt I knew
impossibility And yet I could even read book end I
given reading What good reading good
learning anything six months That thought made throw
aside book
Yes wall Meyer could tell tale liked There
spot dirty surface I know heart Accursed wall
yet dearer Pavlofsk trees That
dearer
I remember hungry interest I began watch lives
people interest I never felt I used wait
Colia arrival impatiently I ill I could
leave house I threw every little detail news
took much interest every report rumour I believe I
became regular gossip I could understand among things
people much life become
I understand I remember told poor
wretch I knew died hunger I almost beside
rage I believe I could resuscitated I would done
sole purpose murdering
Occasionally I much better I could go streets
used put rage I would lock days
rather go even I well enough I could
bear see preoccupied creatures
continuously surging along streets past Why always
anxious What meaning eternal care worry It
wickedness perpetual detestable malice
full malice malice
Whose fault miserable know
live though fifty sixty years life Why
fool allow die hunger sixty years unlived
life
And everyone shows rags hands yells
wrath Here working like cattle lives always
hungry dogs others work fat
rich The eternal refrain And side side trots along
wretched fellow known better days light porter work
morn night living always blubbering saying
wife died money buy medicine
children dying cold hunger eldest daughter gone
bad Oh I pity patience fools
people Why Rothschilds Whose fault man
got millions money like Rothschild If life must
power Whose fault know live
life
Oh But time I would soak
pillow night tears mortification tear blanket
rage fury Oh I longed time turned
eighteen years old poor turned street
quite alone without lodging without work without crust bread
without relations without single acquaintance large
town hungry beaten like good health I would
show
What would I show
Oh think I sense humiliation I
suffered already reading far Which think
fool moment young fool knows nothing life forgetting
live I lived last six months live longer
old men Well let laugh say
nonsense please They may say
like I spent whole nights telling I
remember But I tell The time
They amused I found even time
learn Greek grammar I wanted I shall die I get
syntax I thought first page threw book
table It still I forbade anyone pick
If Explanation gets anybody hands patience
read may consider madman schoolboy
likely man condemned die thought natural
conclude men excepting esteem life far lightly
live far carelessly lazily therefore one
unworthy Well I affirm reader wrong
convictions nothing sentence death Ask ask
one mean happiness Oh
may perfectly sure Columbus happy
discovered America discovering You may quite
sure reached culminating point happiness three days
saw New World actual eyes mutinous
sailors wanted tack return Europe What New
World matter Columbus hardly seen died
reality entirely ignorant discovered The
important thing life life nothing else What discovery
whatever compared incessant eternal discovery life
But use talking I afraid commonplace
confession taken schoolboy exercise work
ambitious lad writing hope work seeing light
perhaps readers say I perhaps something say
know express
Let add every idea emanating genius even
every serious human idea born human brain always remains
something sediment expressed others though
one wrote volumes lectured upon years There
always something remnant never come
brain remain alone ever ever
die perhaps without imparted may
essence idea single living soul
So I impart tormented last
six months events understand reached
last convictions I must paid dear price That
I wished reasons make point
Explanation
But let resume
VI
I deceive Reality got entrapped meshes
past six months I forgot sentence
perhaps I wish think actually busied
affairs
A word circumstances When eight months since I became
ill I threw old connections dropped old
companions As I always gloomy morose sort individual
friends easily forgot course would forgotten
without excuse My position home solitary enough
Five months ago I separated entirely family one
dared enter room except stated times clean tidy
bring meals My mother dared disobey kept
children quiet sake beat dared make
noise disturb I often complained I think
must fond indeed time I think I must
tormented faithful Colia I called good deal He
tormented late I could see always bore tempers
though determined spare poor This annoyed
naturally He seemed taken head imitate
prince Christian meekness Surikoff lived us annoyed
He miserably poor I used prove
one blame poverty I used angry I
think I frightened eventually stopped coming see He
meek humble fellow Surikoff They say
meekness great power I must ask prince
expression But I remember one day March I went
lodgings see whether true one children
starved frozen death I began hold forth
poverty fault course remarks I
accidentally smiled corpse child Well poor wretch
lips began tremble caught shoulder pushed
door Go said whisper I went course
I declare I I liked moment I
turned But words filled strange sort feeling
disdainful pity whenever I thought feeling
I least desire entertain At moment
insult I admit I insult though I mean
man could lose temper His lips trembled I swear
rage He taken arm said Go
without least anger There dignity great deal dignity
inconsistent look I
assure quite comical But anger Perhaps
merely began despise moment
Since time always taken hat stairs
whenever I met thing never always
gets away quickly though felt confused If
despise despised meekly fashion
I dare say took hat fear son
creditor always owed mother money I thought
explanation I knew I would begin
apologize minute two I decided let alone
Just time middle March I suddenly felt
much better continued couple weeks I used go
dusk I like dusk especially March night frost
begins harden day puddles gas burning
Well one night Shestilavochnaya man passed paper
parcel arm I take stock carefully
seemed dressed shabby summer much light
season When opposite ten yards away I
observed something fall pocket I hurried forward pick
time old wretch long kaftan rushed
He dispute matter glanced hand
disappeared
It large stuffed full I guessed
glance anything world inside except money
The owner forty yards ahead soon lost
crowd I ran began calling I knew
nothing say excepting hey turn round Suddenly
turned gate house left I darted
gateway dark I could see nothing whatever It
one large houses built small tenements must
least hundred
When I entered yard I thought I saw man going along far
side dark I could make figure
I crossed corner found dirty dark staircase I heard
man mounting way higher I thinking I
catch door would opened I rushed
I heard door open shut fifth storey I panted
along stairs narrow steps innumerable last I
reached door I thought right one Some moments passed I
found bell got ring
An old peasant woman opened door busy lighting
samovar tiny kitchen She listened silently questions
understand word course opened another door leading
little bit room low scarcely furnished
large wide bed hung curtains On bed lay one
Terentich woman called drunk appeared On
table end candle iron candlestick
vodka nearly finished Terentich muttered something signed
towards next room The old woman disappeared
nothing open door indicated I
entered next room
This still smaller cramped I could scarcely
turn round narrow single bed one side took nearly room
Besides bed three common chairs wretched old
standing small sofa One could hardly squeeze
table bed
On table room burned tallow
iron candlestick bed whined baby scarcely three
weeks old A woman dressing child probably
mother looked though yet got trouble
childbirth seemed weak carelessly dressed Another
child little girl three years old lay sofa covered
looked like man old
At table stood man shirt sleeves thrown
coat lay upon bed unfolding blue paper parcel
couple pounds bread little sausages
On table along things old bits black
bread tea pot From bed protruded
open portmanteau full bundles rags In word confusion
untidiness room indescribable
It appeared first glance man woman
respectable people brought pitch poverty
untidiness seems get better every effort cope till
last take sort bitter satisfaction When I entered
room man entered moment still
unpacking parcels saying something wife excited
manner The news apparently bad usual woman began
whimpering The man face seemed refined even pleasant
He years age wore
black whiskers lip chin shaved He looked morose
sort pride expression A curious scene followed
There people find satisfaction touchy feelings
especially taken deepest offence
moments feel would rather offended These
natures wise always full remorse
afterwards reflect ten times angry
need
The gentleman gazed seconds amazement
wife terror though something alarmingly
extraordinary fact anyone could come see But
suddenly fell upon almost fury I time mutter
couple words doubtless observed I
decently dressed therefore took deep offence I dared
enter den unceremoniously spy squalor untidiness
Of course delighted get hold someone upon vent
rage things general
For moment I thought would assault grew pale
looked like woman hysterics wife dreadfully
alarmed
How dare come Be shouted trembling
rage scarcely able articulate words Suddenly however
observed pocketbook hand
I think dropped I remarked quietly drily I
could I thought best treat For stood
downright terror seemed unable understand He
suddenly grabbed opened mouth alarm beat
forehead hand
My God cried find How I explained
words I could drily possible I seen picked
I run called I
followed upstairs groped way door
Gracious Heaven cried papers My dear
sir little know done us I
lost lost
I taken hold meanwhile intending leave
room without reply I panting run upstairs
exhaustion came climax violent fit coughing bad I
could hardly stand
I saw man dashed room find empty chair
kicked rags chair covered brought
helped sit cough went another three
minutes When I came sitting another
chair also cleared rubbish throwing
floor watching intently
I afraid ill remarked tone doctors use
address patient I medical man say

He jumped
Perhaps exaggerating take proper measures

He terribly confused seem able collect scattered
senses still left hand
Oh mind I said Dr B saw last week I lugged
hash quite settled pardon I took hold
I point opening door leaving
grateful confused medical friend shame
damnable cough got hold
My doctor insisted sitting get breath He
said something wife without leaving place addressed
words gratitude courtesy She seemed shy
sickly face flushed confusion I remained
air man knows intruding anxious get away The
doctor remorse last seemed need vent I could see
If I began breaking abruptly every moment
starting another sentence I I grateful I
much blame eyes I feel sure I see pointed
room moment I position
Oh I said nothing see quite clear case
lost post come make explanations get another
How know asked amazement
Oh evident first glance I said ironically
intentionally There lots people come
provinces full hope run town live best
He began talk excitedly trembling lips began
complaining telling story He interested I confess I sat
nearly hour His story ordinary one He
provincial doctor civil appointment sooner taken
intrigues began Even wife dragged He
proud flew passion change local government
acted favour opponents position undermined
complaints made lost post came
Petersburg last remaining money order appeal higher
authorities Of course nobody would listen long time
would come tell story one day refused promptly another
day would fed false promises would treated
harshly would told sign documents would
sign paper hand would refuse receive
tell file formal petition In word driven
office office five months spent every farthing
wife last rags pawned meanwhile child
born today I final refusal

wife baby lately I I
He sprang chair turned away His wife crying
corner child begun moan I pulled
began writing When I finished rose chair
standing expression alarmed curiosity
I jotted name I told rest
place served district date I
friend Bachmatoff whose uncle councillor state
matters one Peter Matveyevitch Bachmatoff
Peter Matveyevitch Bachmatoff cried trembling
excitement Why nearly everything depends man
It curious story medical man visit
happy termination I contributed accident Everything
fitted novel I told poor people put much hope
I poor schoolboy I really
I humiliated much possible order make less
hopeful I would go Vassili Ostroff see
friend I knew certain uncle adored
absolutely devoted last hope branch family
perhaps old man might something oblige nephew
If would allow explain excellency If I
could permitted tell tale cried trembling
feverish agitation eyes flashing excitement I repeated
I could hold much hope would probably
end smoke I turn next morning must make
minds done matter
They showed bows every kind respect seemed
quite beside I shall never forget expression
faces
I took droshky drove Vassili Ostroff For
years I enmity young Bachmatoff school
We considered aristocrat events I called one He used
dress smartly always drove school private trap He
good companion always merry jolly sometimes even witty
though intellectual spite fact
always top class I never top anything All
companions fond excepting He several times
years come tried make friends I
always turned sulkily away refused anything
I seen whole year university When
nine clock evening I arrived shown
great ceremony first received astonishment
affably soon cheered suddenly gazed intently
burst laughing
Why earth possessed come see
Terentieff cried usual pleasant sometimes audacious
never offensive familiarity I liked reality I
also detested Why matter cried alarm Are
ill
That confounded cough mine come I fell chair
difficulty recovered breath It right
consumption I said I come petition
He sat amazement I lost time telling medical
man history explained influence
possessed uncle might good poor fellow
I I course said I shall attack uncle
tomorrow morning I glad told story But
thought coming Terentieff
So much depends upon uncle I said And besides always
enemies Bachmatoff generous sort fellow I
thought would refuse request I enemy I
added irony
Like Napoleon going England eh cried laughing I
though course I added seeing I rose
seriously chair point
And sure enough matter ended satisfactorily possible A month
later medical friend appointed another post He got
travelling expenses paid something help start life
I think Bachmatoff must persuaded doctor accept
loan I saw Bachmatoff two three times
period third time gave farewell dinner
doctor wife departure champagne dinner
Bachmatoff saw home dinner crossed Nicolai
bridge We little drunk He told joy joyful
feeling done good action said thanks
could feel satisfaction held forth
foolishness theory individual charity useless
I burning say
In Moscow I said old state counsellor civil
general life habit visiting
prisons speaking criminals Every party convicts way
Siberia knew beforehand Vorobeef Hills old general
would pay visit He undertook seriously devotedly
He would walk rows unfortunate prisoners stop
individual ask needs never sermonized
spoke kindly gave money brought sorts
necessaries journey gave devotional books choosing
could read firm conviction would read
could went along
He scarcely ever talked particular crimes
listened volunteered information point All
convicts equal made distinction He spoke
brothers every one looked upon father When
observed among exiles poor woman child would
always come forward fondle little one make laugh He
continued acts mercy death time
criminals Russia Siberia knew
A man I knew Siberia returned told
witness hardened criminals
remembered old general though point fact could never
course distributed pence member
party Their recollection sentimental particularly
devoted Some wretch instance murderer cutting
throat dozen instance stabbing six
little children amusement men would
perhaps without rhyme reason suddenly give sigh say I
wonder whether old general alive still Although perhaps
thought mentioning dozen years How one say
seed good may dropped soul never die
I continued strain long pointing Bachmatoff
impossible follow effects isolated good deed
one may influences subtle workings upon heart
others
And think cut life remarked
Bachmatoff tone reproach though would like find
someone pitch account
We leaning balustrade bridge looking
Neva moment
Do know suddenly come head said I
suddenly leaning rail
Surely throw river cried Bachmatoff
alarm Perhaps read thought face
No yet At present nothing following consideration You
see I two three months left live perhaps four well
supposing I month two I take fancy
good deed needs trouble time like business
doctor friend instance I shall give idea
take something else good deed within
eh Isn amusing idea
Poor Bachmatoff much impressed painfully He took
way home attempting console behaving greatest
delicacy On taking leave pressed hand warmly asked permission
come see I replied came comforter
speak would capacity whether spoke
soothing manner kept silence I pointed
would remind time approaching death He shrugged
shoulders quite agreed parted better friends I
expected
But evening night sown first seeds last
I seized greedily new idea I thirstily drank
different aspects I sleep wink night
deeper I went seemed merge
alarmed I became A dreadful terror came last
leave next day
Sometimes thinking I became quite numb terror
I might well deduced fact last
conviction eating fast seriously
would undoubtedly come climax long And climax I
needed greater determination I yet possessed
However within three weeks determination taken owing
strange circumstance
Here paper I make note figures dates
come explanation Of course
perhaps moment I desire
judge action see clearly logical sequence
deductions length proceeded last conviction
I said determination needed
accomplishment final resolve came hand
sequence causes thanks certain strange circumstance
perhaps connection whatever matter issue Ten days
ago Rogojin called upon certain business
I nothing present I never seen Rogojin
often heard
I gave information needed soon took
departure since came purpose gaining
information matter might expected end
But interested much day I
influence strange thoughts connected I determined
return visit next day
Rogojin evidently means pleased see hinted
delicately saw reason acquaintance continue
For however I spent interesting hour I dare
say There great contrast us I sure
must felt anyhow I felt acutely Here I
days numbered man full vigour life living
present without slightest thought final convictions
numbers days fact anything well
mad excuse expression feeble
author express ideas properly
In spite lack amiability I could help seeing Rogojin
man intellect sense although perhaps little
outside world interest still clearly
man eyes see
I hinted nothing final conviction appeared
guessed words He remained silent
terribly silent man I remarked I rose depart
spite contrast wide differences us two
les extremites se touchent extremes meet I explained
Russian maybe far final conviction
appeared
His reply sour grimace He rose looked
cap placed hand led house
dreadful gloomy house appearances course though I
leaving accord simply seeing
door politeness His house impressed much like
seems like however quite natural
Such full life leads overflowing absorbing interests
little need assistance surroundings
The visit Rogojin exhausted terribly Besides I felt ill
since morning evening I weak I took bed
high fever intervals even delirious Colia sat
eleven clock
Yet I remember talked every word said though
whenever eyes closed moment I could picture nothing
image Surikoff act finding million roubles He could
make mind money tore hair
He trembled fear somebody would rob last
decided bury ground I persuaded instead
putting away uselessly underground better melt
make golden coffin starved child dig
little one put golden coffin Surikoff accepted
suggestion I thought tears gratitude immediately
commenced carry design
I thought I spat ground left disgust Colia told
I quite recovered senses I asleep
moment I spoken Surikoff whole
At moments I state dreadful weakness misery
Colia greatly disturbed left
When I arose lock door I suddenly called mind
picture I noticed Rogojin one gloomiest rooms
door He pointed walked past
I believe I must stood good five minutes front There
nothing artistic picture made feel strangely
uncomfortable It represented Christ taken cross It
seems painters rule represent Saviour
cross taken great beauty still upon His face
This marvellous beauty strive preserve even His moments
deepest agony passion But beauty Rogojin
picture This presentment poor mangled body
evidently suffered unbearable anguish even crucifixion full
wounds bruises marks violence soldiers people
bitterness moment He fallen cross
combined anguish actual crucifixion
The face depicted though still suffering though body
dead still almost quivering agony The picture
one pure nature face beautified artist
left would naturally whosoever sufferer
anguish
I know earliest Christian faith taught Saviour
suffered actually figuratively nature allowed
way even His body cross
It strange look dreadful picture mangled corpse
Saviour put question oneself Supposing
disciples future apostles women followed Him stood
cross believed worshipped Him supposing
saw tortured body face mangled bleeding
bruised seen could gazed upon
dreadful sight yet believed He would rise
The thought steps whether one likes death
terrible powerful even He conquered His miracles
life unable triumph last He called
Lazarus Lazarus come forth dead man lived He
Himself prey nature death Nature appears one looking
picture huge implacable dumb monster still better
stranger simile enormous mechanical engine modern days
seized crushed swallowed great invaluable Being
Being worth nature laws worth whole earth
perhaps created merely sake advent Being
This blind dumb implacable eternal unreasoning force well shown
picture absolute subordination men things
well expressed idea unconsciously arises mind
anyone looks All faithful people gazing
cross mutilated occupant must suffered agony mind
evening must felt hopes almost
faith shattered blow They must separated
terror dread night though perhaps carried away
one great thought never eradicated mind ever
afterwards If great Teacher could seen Himself
Crucifixion could He consented mount Cross
die He This thought also comes mind man
gazes picture I thought snatches probably
attacks delirium hour half
Colia departure
Can appearance form And yet seemed
certain moments I beheld strange impossible
form dark dumb irresistibly powerful eternal force
I thought someone led hand showed light
candle huge loathsome insect assured
force almighty dumb irresistible Power laughed
indignation I received information In room
always light little lamp icon night gives
feeble flicker light strong enough see dimly
sit even read I think
twelve little past night I slept wink
lying eyes wide open suddenly door opened came
Rogojin
He entered shut door behind Then silently gazed
went quickly corner room lamp burning
sat underneath
I much surprised looked expectantly
Rogojin leaned elbow table silently stared
So passed two three minutes I recollect silence hurt
offended much Why speak
That arrival time night struck less
strange may possibly case I remember I means
amazed On contrary though I actually told
thought morning yet I know understood thought
character would anything remarkable
one come talk hour night
however late
I thought must come purpose
In morning parted best friends I remember
looked disagreeable sarcasm twice look
I observed eyes cause annoyance I felt
I moment suspect I delirious
Rogojin result fever excitement I
slightest idea theory first
Meanwhile continued sit stare jeeringly
I angrily turned round bed made mind I would say
word unless I rested silently pillow determined
remain dumb last till morning I felt resolved
speak first Probably twenty minutes passed way
Suddenly idea struck apparition
Rogojin
Neither illness previous time I ever seen
apparition I always thought I little boy
even I see one I die spot though I
believe ghosts And yet idea struck
ghost Rogojin I least alarmed
Nay thought actually irritated Strangely enough decision
question whether ghost Rogojin
reason interest nearly much ought
done I think I began muse something altogether different For
instance I began wonder Rogojin
slippers I saw home put
white waistcoat tie I also thought I remember
ghost I afraid I approach
verify suspicions Perhaps I afraid And sooner last
idea enter head icy blast blew I felt chill
backbone knees shook
At moment though divining thoughts Rogojin raised
head arm began part lips though going
laugh continued stare persistently
I felt furious moment I longed rush
I sworn speak first I continued lie
still willingly I still means satisfied
whether really Rogojin
I remember long lasted I recollect either
whether consciousness forsook intervals But last
Rogojin rose staring intently ever smiling
longer walking softly almost door
opened went shut behind
I rise bed I know long I lay
eyes open thinking I know I thought I fell
asleep became insensible I awoke next morning nine clock
knocked door My general orders I open
door call nine clock Matreona come bring
tea When I opened door thought suddenly struck
could come since door locked I made
inquiries found Rogojin could possibly come
doors locked night
Well strange circumstance I described
much detail ultimate cause led taking final
determination So logic logical deductions anything
resolve simply matter disgust
It impossible go living life full
detestable strange tormenting forms This ghost humiliated
could I bear subordinate dark horrible force
embodied form loathsome insect It
towards evening I quite made mind point I
began feel easier

O puissent voir longtemps votre beauté sacrée
Tant amis sourds à mes adieux
Qu ils meurent pleins de jours que leur mort soit pleurée
Qu un ami leur ferme les yeux
But believe believe friends
highly moral verse academical blessing world general
French language hidden intensest gall bitterness
well concealed venom I dare say poet actually
persuaded words full tears pardon
peace instead bitterness disappointment malice
died delusion
Do know limit ignominy beyond man
consciousness shame go begins satisfaction
shame Well course humility great force sense I admit
though sense religion accounts humility
strength
Religion I admit eternal life perhaps I always admit
Admitted consciousness called existence
Higher Power admitted consciousness looks upon world
says I admitted Higher Power wills
consciousness called existence suddenly extinguished
unexplained reason must still comes
eternal question must I humble Is
enough I devoured without expected bless
power devours Surely surely I need suppose
Somebody offended I wish live
fortnight allowed I believe
It much simpler far likely believe death
needed death insignificant atom order fulfil
general harmony universe order make even plus
minus sum existence Just every day death numbers
beings necessary without annihilation rest
live although must admit idea particularly
grand one
However admit fact Admit without perpetual devouring
one another world continue exist could never
organized I ever ready confess I understand
I tell I know certain If I
given understand realize I matter
world organized system full errors
otherwise organized Who judge
Say like thing impossible unjust
And meanwhile I never able spite great desire
persuade future existence
Providence
The fact matter exist know
absolutely nothing future life laws
But difficult even impossible understand surely
I blamed I could fathom incomprehensible
Of course I know say one must obedient course
prince one say one must obedient
without questions pure goodness heart worthy
conduct matter I shall meet reward another world We
degrade God attribute ideas Him annoyance
fathom His ways
Again I repeat I blamed I unable understand
given mankind fathom Why I judged
I could comprehend Will Laws Providence No
better drop religion
And enough By time I got far reading
document sun huge force rays
acting upon living world So I shall die gazing straight
great Fountain life power I want life
If I power prevent birth I certainly never
consented accept existence ridiculous conditions
However I power end existence although I give
back days already numbered It insignificant gift
revolt equally insignificant
Final explanation I die least I unable
support next three weeks Oh I find strength enough
I wished I could obtain consolation thought
injury done But I French poet I desire
consolation And finally nature limited capacity
work activity kind allotting three weeks time
suicide thing left I begin end
time free
Perhaps I anxious take advantage last chance
something A protest sometimes small thing
The explanation finished Hippolyte paused last
There extreme cases final stage cynical candour
nervous man excited beside emotion afraid

extraordinary almost unnatural tension nerves upheld
Hippolyte point arrived final stage This

green bench Aglaya pointed rendezvous He sat
suddenly burst loud fit laughter immediately
followed feeling irritation His disturbance mind continued
felt must go away somewhere anywhere
Above head little bird sang sudden began peer
among leaves Suddenly bird darted tree
away instantly thought fly buzzing
sun rays Hippolyte talked knew place
participator universal life alone
This picture impressed time meditated
upon An old forgotten memory awoke brain suddenly
burst clearness light It recollection Switzerland
first year cure first months At time
pretty nearly idiot still could speak properly
difficulty understanding others spoke He climbed
one sunny morning wandered long aimlessly
certain thought brain would become clear Above
blazing sky lake around horizon
clear infinite He looked upon long anxiously He
remembered stretched arms towards beautiful
boundless blue horizon wept wept What tormented
idea stranger outside
glorious festival

paroxysm exaltation I give every drop blood Illustrious
prince I poor wretch soul spirit ask veriest
scoundrel whether would prefer deal one like

He answer prefers man
triumph virtue honoured prince You I
together softly softly

The prince understood last shivered dread every time
thought three letters pocket put
reading evening
When fell heavy sleep sofa verandah without
courage open single one three envelopes
dreamed painful dream poor sinful woman
appeared Again gazed tears sparkling long
lashes beckoned awoke
picture face haunting
He longed get go At length
almost despair unfolded letters began read
These letters like dream We sometimes strange
impossible dreams contrary laws nature When awake
remember wonder strangeness You remember perhaps
full possession reason succession
fantastic images even acted extraordinary logic
cunning surrounded murderers hid intentions made
great demonstrations friendship waiting opportunity
cut throat You remember escaped ingenious
stratagem doubted really deceived whether
pretending know
thought another plan hoodwinked You remember
quite clearly reason calmly accepted
manifest absurdities impossibilities crowded
dream One murderers suddenly changed woman
eyes woman transformed hideous cunning little
dwarf believed accepted almost matter
course time intelligence seemed unusually keen
accomplished miracles cunning sagacity logic Why
awake world realities nearly always feel
sometimes vividly vanished dream carried
enigma failed solve You smile extravagance
dream yet feel tissue absurdity contained
real idea something belongs true life something
exists always existed heart You search
dream prophecy expecting It left deep
impression upon joyful cruel means
predicted neither understand remember
The reading letters produced effect upon prince
He felt even opened envelopes fact
existence like nightmare How could ever made
mind write asked How could write
And could wild idea entered head
And yet strangest part matter read
letters almost believed possibility even
justification idea thought wild Of course
mad dream nightmare yet something cruelly real
For hours haunted read Several passages
returned mind brooded
felt inclined say foreseen known
written even seemed read whole
time long long ago tormented
grieved found old long since read
letters
When open letter first began look first
signature The signature tell I need explain
nothing attempt justify Were I way footing
might offended audacity I
We extremes I far removed
I could offend I wished
Farther another place wrote Do consider words
sickly ecstasies diseased mind
opinion perfection I seen I see every day I
judge I weighed scales Reason found
Perfection simply article faith But I must confess one sin
I love One love perfection One
look perfection yet I love Though love
equalizes fear I lowered level even
secret thoughts I written Do fear could
fear I would kiss footprints I could oh I putting
level Look signature quick look
signature
However observe wrote another letters although
I couple yet I asked whether love
He fell love though saw He spoke
These words I heard use
But I understood without saying light
I lived near whole month I understood
must love I think one
What matter yesterday wrote another sheet I passed
seemed Perhaps fancy
If I bring loathsome den show
revelation undisguised vice blush You never feel
sense personal affront You may hate mean base
unworthy wrong No
one wrong Do know I think ought love
eyes light An angel
hate perhaps love either I often ask possible
love everybody Indeed nature Abstract love
humanity nearly always love self But different You
help loving since compare none
personal offence anger Oh bitter would
know felt anger shame account would
fall would become comparable
Yesterday seeing I went home thought picture
Artists always draw Saviour actor one Gospel
stories I differently I represent Christ alone
disciples leave Him alone occasionally I paint one little
child left Him This child playing near Him
probably telling Saviour something pretty
baby prattle Christ listened musing one
hand reposing child bright head His eyes
expression Thought great Universe His face sad
The little one leans elbow upon Christ knee cheek
resting hand gazes Him pondering children sometimes
ponder The sun setting There picture
You innocent innocence lies perfection oh
remember What passion mine I shall
near life I shall live long
At length last letter found
For Heaven sake misunderstand Do think I
humiliate writing thus I belong class
people take satisfaction humiliating pride
I consolation though would difficult explain I
humiliate
Why I wish unite two For sakes For
sake naturally All problems life would thus solved
I thought long time I know sister
Adelaida saw portrait said beauty could overthrow
world But I renounced world You think strange
I say saw decked lace diamonds
company drunkards wastrels Take notice I know
I almost ceased exist God knows dwelling within
I see every day two dreadful eyes
always looking even present These eyes silent
say nothing I know secret His house gloomy
secret I convinced box razor
hidden tied round silk like one Moscow murderer
This man also lived mother razor hidden away
tied round white silk razor intended cut
throat
All I house I felt sure somewhere beneath
floor hidden away dreadful corpse wrapped
perhaps buried father knows Just
Moscow case I could shown spot
He always silent I know well loves much
must hate My wedding day I
arranged I secrets I would kill
fright kill first He burst laughing
says I raving He knows I writing
There much delirious wandering letters one
long
At last prince came dark gloomy park
wandered hours yesterday The bright night seemed
lighter ever It must quite early thought He
forgotten watch There sound distant music somewhere
Ah thought Vauxhall They today course
At moment noticed close house felt
must gravitate spot eventually beating
heart mounted verandah steps
No one met verandah empty nearly pitch dark He opened
door room dark empty He stood
middle room perplexity Suddenly door opened came
Alexandra candle hand Seeing prince stopped

He walked along road towards house His heart beating

And suddenly twice already awaked sleep
vision apparition seemed rise The
woman appeared step park stand path front

He shuddered stopped seized hand pressed frenziedly
No apparition

Ha ha I never supposed would say yes cried Rogojin laughing
sardonically
And disappeared without looking round
PART IV
I
A week elapsed since rendezvous two friends
green bench park one fine morning ten
clock Varvara Ardalionovna otherwise Ptitsin
visit friend returned home state considerable mental
depression
There certain people difficult say anything
throw relief words describe
graphically typical characteristics These
generally known commonplace people class comprises
course immense majority mankind Authors rule attempt
select portray types rarely met entirety
types nevertheless real real life
Podkoleosin A character Gogol comedy The Wedding perhaps
exaggeration means character
contrary many intelligent people hearing Podkoleosin
Gogol immediately began find scores friends
exactly like They knew perhaps Gogol told
friends like Podkoleosin know name give
In real life young fellows seldom jump window
weddings feat speak
aspects must decidedly unpleasant mode escape yet
plenty bridegrooms intelligent fellows would ready
confess Podkoleosins depths consciousness
marriage Nor every husband feel bound repeat
every step l voulu Georges Dandin like another typical
personage yet many millions billions Georges Dandins
real life feel inclined utter cry
honeymoon day wedding Therefore
without entering serious examination question I
content remarking real life typical characters
watered speak Dandins Podkoleosins
actually exist among us every day diluted form I
add however Georges Dandin might existed exactly Molière
presented probably exist though rarely
I end scientific examination beginning
look like newspaper criticism But question
remains novelists commonplace people
presented reader form
least degree interesting They left altogether
commonplace people meet one every turn life leave
would destroy whole reality probability story To
fill novel typical characters merely strange
uncommon people would render book unreal improbable
would likely destroy interest In opinion duty
novelist seek points interest instruction even
characters commonplace people
For instance whole essence ordinary person nature lies
perpetual unchangeable commonplaceness spite
endeavours something common person ends
eventually remaining unbroken line routine I think
individual really become type type
commonplaceness world help
contented strains yearns something original
independent without slightest possibility To
class commonplace people belong several characters
novel characters I admit I drawn vividly
reader benefit
Such instance Varvara Ardalionovna Ptitsin husband
brother Gania
There nothing annoying fairly rich fairly good
family pleasing presence average education stupid
yet talent originality
single idea one fact like everyone else
Of people countless numbers world far even
appear They divided two classes men
limited intellect much cleverer The
former classes happier
To commonplace man limited intellect instance nothing
simpler imagine original character revel
belief without slightest misgiving
Many young women thought fit cut hair short put
blue spectacles call Nihilists By
able persuade without trouble
acquired new convictions Some men felt
little qualm kindness towards fact
quite enough persuade stand alone van
enlightenment one humanitarian feelings
Others read idea somebody else
immediately assimilate believe child
brain The impudence ignorance I may use expression
developed wonderful extent cases unlikely appears
met every turn
This confidence stupid man talents wonderfully
depicted Gogol amazing character Pirogoff Pirogoff
slightest doubt genius nay
genius certain never questions How
many Pirogoffs among writers scholars
propagandists I say indeed plenty
day
Our friend Gania belonged class much cleverer
persons though head foot permeated saturated
longing original This class I said far
less happy For clever commonplace person though may possibly
imagine man genius originality none less
within heart deathless worm suspicion doubt
doubt sometimes brings clever man despair As rule however
nothing tragic happens liver becomes little damaged
course time nothing serious Such men give
aspirations originality without severe struggle
men though good fellows even benefactors
humanity sunk level base criminals sake
originality
Gania beginner upon road A deep
unchangeable consciousness lack talent combined
vast longing able persuade original
rankled heart even childhood
He seemed born overwrought nerves
passionate desire excel often led brink
rash step yet resolved upon step moment
arrived invariably proved sensible take He ready
way base action order obtain
object yet moment came found
honest great baseness Not objected acts petty
meanness always ready He looked hate
loathing poverty downfall family treated
mother haughty contempt although knew whole future
depended character reputation
Aglaya simply frightened yet give thoughts
though never seriously hoped would condescend
At time adventure Nastasia Philipovna come
conclusion money hope money
At moment lost Aglaya scene Nastasia
felt low eyes actually brought money back
prince Of returning money given madwoman
received madman often repented since though
never ceased proud action During short time
Muishkin remained Petersburg Gania time come hate
sympathy though prince told everyone
would acted nobly return money He long
pondered relations Aglaya persuaded
strange childish innocent character things
might ended differently Remorse seized threw
post buried reproach
He lived Ptitsin openly showed contempt latter though
always listened advice sensible enough ask
wanted Gavrila Ardalionovitch angry Ptitsin
latter care become Rothschild If
Jew said properly squeeze people right left show
character King Jews
Ptitsin quiet easily offended laughed But one
occasion explained seriously Gania Jew
nothing dishonest could help market price money
thanks accurate habits already good footing
respected business flourishing
I ever Rothschild reason I
added smiling I shall house Liteynaya perhaps two
enough Who knows I may three
concluded dream cherished inwardly never
confided soul
Nature loves favours people Ptitsin certainly
reward three houses four precisely childhood
realized would never Rothschild That
limit Ptitsin fortune come may never
four houses
Varvara Ardalionovna like brother She passionate
desires persistent rather impetuous Her plans
wise methods carrying No doubt also belonged
category ordinary people dream original
soon discovered grain true originality
let trouble much Perhaps certain kind pride
came help She made first concession demands
practical life great resolution consented marry
Ptitsin However married say Never
mind mean action leads end view brother would
certainly said case quite probable may
said expressed satisfaction
decision Far Varvara Ardalionovna marry
felt convinced future husband unassuming agreeable
almost cultured nothing earth would tempt really
dishonourable deed As small meannesses trifles trouble
Indeed free It absurd expect ideal
Besides knew marriage would provide refuge
family Seeing Gania unhappy anxious help spite
former disputes misunderstandings Ptitsin friendly way
would press enter army You know said
sometimes jokingly despise generals generaldom
see end generals turn You
see live long enough
But suppose I despise generals Gania thought
sarcastically
To serve brother interests Varvara Ardalionovna constantly
Epanchins house helped fact childhood Gania
played General Ivan Fedorovitch daughters It would
inconsistent character visits pursuing
chimera project chimerical building
firm basis knowledge character Epanchin family
especially Aglaya studied closely All Varvara efforts
directed towards bringing Aglaya Gania together Perhaps
achieved result perhaps also made mistake depending
much upon brother expecting would
ever capable giving However may manoeuvres
skilful enough For weeks time would never mention Gania Her
attitude modest dignified always extremely truthful
sincere Examining depths conscience found nothing
reproach still strengthened
designs But Varvara Ardalionovna sometimes remarked felt
spiteful good deal vanity perhaps even
wounded vanity She noticed certain times others
especially visits Epanchins
Today I said returned house heavy
feeling dejection There sensation bitterness sort
mocking contempt mingled
Arrived house Varia heard considerable commotion going
upper storey distinguished voices father
brother On entering salon found Gania pacing
frantic speed pale rage almost tearing hair She frowned
subsided sofa tired air without taking
trouble remove hat She well knew kept quiet
asked brother nothing reason tearing
room wrath would fall upon head So hastened put
question
The old story eh
Old story No Heaven knows I Father simply
gone mad mother floods tears Upon word Varia I must kick
house else go added probably remembering
could well turn people house
You must make allowances murmured Varia
Make allowances For Him old blackguard No Varia

Gania listened attentively sister astonishment

May I ask good leave room
You better speak You sorry afterwards
Hippolyte stop please It dreadfully undignified said Varia
Well sake lady said Hippolyte laughing I

without clearing misunderstandings first
In word wretched little cried Gania

Gania silent merely looked contemptuously
You Very well I shall short possible part Two
three times I word hospitality pushed

little queer But need whatever hate I
quite understood brother first offered aid
prince though I show I knew well brother
making ridiculous mistake I ready spare however
even solely respect Varvara Ardalionovna
Having shown I quite fool I look
I fished rod line good long
I caught I proceed explain I specially wished
make brother look fool That motive power hate I
attempt conceal I felt dying I dying
however much fatter I may appear I must absolutely make fool
least one class men dogged life
I hate cordially prominently represented
much esteemed brother I enjoy paradise nearly much
without done first I hate Gavrila Ardalionovitch
solely may seem curious I repeat solely
type incarnation head crown impudent
vulgar detestable form
commonplaceness You ordinary ordinary chance
ever fathering pettiest idea And yet jealous
conceited possibly consider great
genius persuaded although dark moments
doubt rage even fact seems uncertain There spots
darkness horizon though disappear become
completely stupid But long chequered path lies
I glad In first place never gain certain
person
Come come This intolerable You better stop little
wretch cried Varia Gania grown pale
trembled said nothing
Hippolyte paused looked intently great
gratification He turned gaze upon Varia bowed went
without adding another word
Gania might justly complain hardness fate treated
Varia dared speak long strode past
backwards forwards At last went stood window looking
back turned towards There fearful row going
upstairs
Are said Gania suddenly remarking risen
leave room Wait moment look
He approached table laid small sheet paper It
looked like little note
Good heavens cried Varia raising hands
This note
GAVRILA ARDOLIONOVITCH persuaded kindness heart I
determined ask advice matter great importance
I like meet tomorrow morning seven clock green
bench park It far house Varvara Ardalionovna
must accompany knows place well
A E
What earth one make girl like said Varia
Gania little felt inclined swagger moment could
avoid showing triumph especially humiliating
remarks Hippolyte A smile beamed
face Varia brimming delight
And day announce engagement
What next
What suppose wants talk tomorrow asked Gania
Oh The chief thing wants see
six months absence Look Gania business
Don swagger lose game play carefully funk

The general stopped turned round raised hands remarked My
curse upon house
Which observation always made theatrical tone
possible muttered Gania shutting window bang
The neighbours undoubtedly hear Varia rushed room
No sooner sister left alone Gania took note
pocket kissed pirouetted around
III
As general rule old General Ivolgin paroxysms ended smoke He
experienced fits sudden fury often
really man peaceful kindly disposition He
tried hundreds times overcome dissolute habits
contracted late years He would suddenly remember
father would reconciled wife shed genuine tears
His feeling Nina Alexandrovna amounted almost adoration
pardoned much silence loved still spite state
degradation fallen But general struggles
weakness never lasted long He way
impetuous man quiet life repentance bosom family
soon became insupportable In end rebelled flew
rages regretted perhaps even gave way
beyond control He picked quarrels everyone
began hold forth eloquently exacted unlimited respect last
disappeared house sometimes return long
time He given interfering affairs family
two years knew nothing gathered
hearsay
But occasion something serious usual
Everyone seemed know something afraid talk
The general turned bosom family two three days
usual olive branch peace hand
garb penitence usually clad
occasions contrary uncommonly bad temper He
arrived quarrelsome mood pitching everyone came across
talking sorts kinds subjects unexpected
manner impossible discover
really putting At moments would apparently quite bright
happy rule would sit moody thoughtful He would
abruptly commence hold forth Epanchins Lebedeff
prince equally abruptly would stop short refuse speak
another word answering questions stupid smile
unconscious smiling asked question
The whole previous night spent tossing groaning
poor Nina Alexandrovna busy making cold compresses warm
fomentations without clear apply He
fallen asleep long awaked
state violent hypochondria ended quarrel
Hippolyte solemn cursing Ptitsin establishment generally
It also observed two three days
state morbid specially touchy points
honour Colia insisted discussing matter mother
outcome abstinence drink perhaps
pining Lebedeff time general
upon terms greatest friendship reason
quarrelled days since parting great
wrath There also scene prince Colia asked
explanation latter forced conclude
told whole truth
If Hippolyte Nina Alexandrovna Gania suspected
special conversation general actions strange
malicious youth Gania called face
allowed similar satisfaction Colia
The fact probably Hippolyte quite black Gania
painted hardly likely informed Nina
Alexandrovna certain events know mere pleasure
giving pain We must never forget human motives
generally far complicated apt suppose
rarely accurately describe motives another It much
better writer rule content bare
statement events shall take line regard
catastrophe recorded shall state remaining events
connected general trouble shortly feel
already given secondary character story
attention originally intended
The course events marched following order When Lebedeff
returned company general expedition town
days since purpose investigation brought prince
information whatever If latter occupied
thoughts impressions time must observed
Lebedeff uncommunicative even appeared
anxious avoid
When prince give matter little attention recalled
fact days always found Lebedeff
radiantly good spirits happened meet
general Lebedeff always together The two friends
seem ever parted moment
Occasionally prince heard loud talking laughing upstairs
detected sound jolly soldier song going
recognized unmistakable bass general voice But sudden
outbreak song last hour afterwards animated
sound apparently drunken conversation continued heard
At length clearest evidence grand mutual
embracing someone burst tears Shortly however
violent quarrel loud talking
sides
All days Colia state great mental preoccupation
Muishkin usually day came home late night On
return invariably informed Colia looking
However meet Colia never anything particular
tell excepting highly dissatisfied general
present condition mind behaviour
They drag place said get drunk together
pub close quarrel street way home
embrace one another seem part moment
When prince pointed nothing new
always behaved manner together Colia know
say fact could explain specially
worried father
On morning following bacchanalian songs quarrels recorded

The phrase flattered general touched pleased mightily
He immediately changed tone started long solemn
explanation But listen would prince could make neither head
tail
The general spoke hotly quickly ten minutes spoke though
words could keep pace crowding thoughts Tears stood

Enough concluded last understand

broken upon every chance comer every impertinent guest
plenty stupid impertinent fellows bent

The prince rather alarmed obliged end
appointing hour following day interview desired
The general left much comforted far less agitated

At seven evening prince sent request Lebedeff pay
visit Lebedeff came esteemed honour

plain everyone expected something everyone looked
though anxious congratulate greeted hints
smiles knowing looks
Keller instance run house three times late

insinuation
The prince however immediately began show annoyance
question Lebedeff categorically general present condition

Everyone worries prince especially strange
troublous times Lebedeff replied drily air
man disappointed reasonable expectations
Dear philosopher laughed prince

Lebedeff assumed air dignity It true enough

excessively cunning gentleman prince almost converting

IV
The time appointed twelve clock prince returning home
unexpectedly late found general waiting At first
glance saw latter displeased perhaps

I brought book back began indicating book lying
table Much obliged lending
Ah yes Well read general It curious said
prince delighted able open conversation upon outside
subject
Curious enough yes crude course dreadful nonsense
probably man lies every sentence
The general spoke considerable confidence dragged words
conceited drawl
Oh simple tale old soldier saw French

There much might improved said prince
moderately qualities though amid one
discern cunning nature reveal often diverting
intellect
The prince tone natural respectful general could
possibly suspect insincerity
Oh possesses good traits I first show I
nearly made present friendship I dependent upon
hospitality upon house I family I attempt

Of course happened easily naturally And yet
novelist describe episode would put kinds

read paper help thinking
strange disclosures gained full knowledge Russian life

prince warmly delighted found refuge fiery
blushes covered face

gratification A small boy child would naturally realize

He left room quickly covering face hands
The prince could doubt sincerity agitation He
understood old man left room intoxicated
success The general belonged class liars spite
transports lying invariably suspect
believed On occasion recovered exaltation
would probably suspect Muishkin pitying feel insulted
Have I acting rightly allowing develop vast
resources imagination prince asked But answer
fit violent laughter lasted ten whole minutes He tried
reproach laughing fit eventually concluded
since spite truly sorry old man
The evening received strange letter short decided The
general informed must part ever grateful
even could accept signs sympathy
humiliating dignity man already miserable enough
When prince heard old man gone Nina Alexandrovna
though felt almost easy account
We seen however general paid visit Lizabetha
Prokofievna caused trouble final upshot

Gania
He turned disgrace eventually

last
V
In point fact Varia rather exaggerated certainty
news prince betrothal Aglaya Very likely
perspicacity sex gave accomplished fact
felt pretty sure become fact days Perhaps could
resist satisfaction pouring one last drop bitterness
brother Gania cup spite love At events
unable obtain definite news Epanchin
girls could get hints surmises
Perhaps Aglaya sisters merely pumping Varia news
pretending impart information perhaps
unable resist feminine gratification teasing friend
time could scarcely helped divining aim
frequent visits
On hand prince although told Lebedeff
know nothing happened nothing impart
prince may error Something strange seemed
happened without anything definite actually happened Varia
guessed true feminine instinct
How came everyone Epanchins became imbued
one conviction something important happened
Aglaya fate process settlement would
difficult explain But sooner idea taken root
declared seen observed long ago
remarked time poor knight joke even
though unwilling believe nonsense
So said sisters Of course Lizabetha Prokofievna foreseen
long rest heart sore long
declared sore appeared quite
overwhelmed thought prince became distasteful
There question decided important difficult
much Epanchin even see put
words Would prince Was good bad If good
might case course good If bad
hardly doubtful especially bad Even general
paterfamilias though astonished first suddenly declared upon
honour really believed fancied something kind
At first seemed new idea somehow looked
familiar His wife frowned This
morning evening alone wife given
tongue
Well really know silence course know
strange true I deny silence But
hand one looks things face know upon
honour prince rare good fellow well name
know family name looks well perpetuates
name title moment standing
high might one point view know The world
world world course people talk
prince property know large
Continued silence collapse general
Hearing words husband Lizabetha Prokofievna driven
beside
According opinion whole thing one huge
fantastical absurd unpardonable mistake First prince
idiot secondly fool knows nothing world
place Whom shown Where take
What old Bielokonski say We never thought husband
Aglaya
Of course last argument chief one The maternal heart
trembled indignation think absurdity although
heart rose another voice said And
prince husband would desired Aglaya It
voice annoyed Lizabetha Prokofievna anything else
For reason sisters liked idea prince They
even consider strange word might expected
moment range strongly side But
decided say nothing either way It always noticed
family stronger Epanchin opposition project
nearer reality giving
Alexandra however found difficult keep absolute silence
subject Long since holding post confidential
adviser mamma perpetually called council asked
opinion especially assistance order recollect
earth happened Why one see Why one say
anything What wretched poor knight joke mean
Why Lizabetha Prokofievna driven think foresee
worry everybody sucked thumbs counted
crows garden nothing At first Alexandra
careful merely replied perhaps father remark
far eyes world probably choice
prince husband one Epanchin girls would considered
wise one Warming however added prince
means fool never place world
one knew position respectable person Russia would
imply years whether would depend successes
government service old system
To mother replied Alexandra freethinker
due cursed woman rights question
Half hour conversation went town thence
Kammenny Ostrof Stone Island suburb park St
Petersburg see Princess Bielokonski arrived
Moscow short visit The princess Aglaya godmother
Old Bielokonski listened fevered despairing lamentations
Lizabetha Prokofievna without least emotion tears
sorrowful mother evoke answering sighs fact laughed
She dreadful old despot princess could allow
equality anything even friendship oldest standing
insisted treating Epanchin
years ago She could never put independence
energy Lizabetha character She observed usual whole
family gone much far ahead converted fly
elephant far heard story persuaded
nothing seriousness occurred would surely
better wait something happen prince
opinion decent young fellow though perhaps little
eccentric illness quite weighty world one
could wish The worst feature said Nastasia Philipovna
Lizabetha Prokofievna well understood old lady angry
failure Evgenie Pavlovitch recommendation She returned
home Pavlofsk worse humour left course
everybody house suffered She pitched everyone
declared gone Why things always mismanaged
house Why everybody frantic hurry matter
So far could see nothing whatever happened Surely
better wait see happen instead making mountains
molehills
And conclusion matter would far better
take quietly wait coolly see would turn But alas
peace reign ten minutes The first blow dealt
power certain news communicated Lizabetha Prokofievna
events happened trip see princess This
trip taken place day prince turned
Epanchins nearly one clock night thinking
nine
The sisters replied candidly fully enough mother
impatient questions return They said first place
nothing particular happened since departure prince
Aglaya kept waiting long
appeared half hour least come
immediately asked prince game chess prince
know game Aglaya beaten easily
wonderfully merry mood laughed prince
chaffed unmercifully one quite sorry see wretched
expression
She asked play cards game called little fools
At game tables turned completely prince shown
master Aglaya cheated changed cards stolen
others way spite everything
prince beaten hopelessly five times running
left little fool time
Aglaya lost temper began say awful things
prince laughed grew dreadfully pale especially
said remain house
ought ashamed coming house especially
night
So saying left room banging door
prince went looking though way funeral
spite attempts consolation
Suddenly quarter hour prince departure Aglaya
rushed room hurry even wiped
eyes full tears She came back Colia brought
hedgehog Everybody came see hedgehog In answer
questions Colia explained hedgehog
left another boy Kostia Lebedeff waiting outside Kostia
shy come carrying hatchet bought
hedgehog hatchet peasant met
road He offered sell hedgehog paid fifty
copecks hatchet taken fancy
made minds buy accord On hearing
Aglaya urged Colia sell hedgehog even called dear
Colia trying coax He refused long time last
could hold went fetch Kostia Lebedeff The latter
appeared carrying hatchet covered confusion Then came
hedgehog property schoolmate
one Petroff given money buy Schlosser History
another schoolfellow moment driven
raising money sale books Colia Kostia
make purchase friend chance brought hedgehog
notice succumbed temptation buying
They taking Petroff hedgehog hatchet
bought money instead Schlosser History But Aglaya
entreated last consented sell hedgehog As
soon got possession put wicker basket

Her father mother sisters came room much struck
last words caught entered absurdity

Aglaya spoken
They exchanged glances questioningly prince seem
understood meaning Aglaya words highest
heaven delight
Why speak murmured Why ask forgiveness
He wished add unworthy asked forgiveness
paused Perhaps understand Aglaya sentence
absurdity meant nothing like strange fellow
rejoiced words
Undoubtedly fact might come see Aglaya much
pleased quite enough make perfectly happy
might come speak see sit walk
knows quite enough satisfy
whole life would desire end
time
Lizabetha Prokofievna felt might case
like though probably could put idea
words
It would difficult describe animation high spirits
distinguished prince rest evening
He happy made one feel happy look
Aglaya sisters expressed afterwards He talked told stories
done never since namely
first morning acquaintance Epanchins six months ago
Since return Petersburg Moscow remarkably
silent told Prince one occasion everyone
think justified degrading thought unworthy
words
But evening nearly talking told stories
dozen answered questions put clearly
gladly amount detail
There nothing however talk His ideas
serious kind even mystical profound
He aired views various matters private
opinions observations many would seemed rather funny
hearers agreed afterwards well expressed
The general liked serious subjects conversation
Lizabetha Prokofievna felt little much
good thing tonight evening advanced grew
less melancholy towards night prince fell telling funny
stories always first burst laughing
invariably joyously simply rest laughed
much stories
As Aglaya hardly said word evening listened
ears Lef Nicolaievitch talk scarcely took
eyes
She looked stared stared hung every word
said said Lizabetha afterwards husband yet tell
loves furious
What done It fate said general shrugging
shoulders long continued repeat It
fate fate
We may add business man like General Epanchin present
position affairs unsatisfactory He hated uncertainty
perforce left However decided say
merely look take time tune
Lizabetha Prokofievna
The happy state family spent evening
recorded long duration Next day Aglaya quarrelled
prince continued behave next days
For whole hours time ridiculed chaffed wretched man
made almost
It true used sit little together
hour two time often observed
occasions prince would read paper book aloud
Aglaya
Do know Aglaya said interrupting reading I
remarked dreadfully badly educated You never know anything
thoroughly one asks neither anyone name dates
treaties It great pity know
I told I much education replied prince
How I respect case Read No
Stop reading
And evening Aglaya mystified Prince S
returned Aglaya particularly amiable asked
great deal Evgenie Pavlovitch Muishkin come yet
Suddenly Prince hinted something new approaching
change He led remark communication
inadvertently made Lizabetha Prokofievna Adelaida
marriage must postponed little longer order two
weddings might come together
It impossible describe Aglaya irritation She flared
said indignant words silly insinuations
She added intentions yet replacing anybody
mistress
These words painfully impressed whole party especially
parents Lizabetha Prokofievna summoned secret council two
insisted upon general demanding prince full explanation
relations Nastasia Philipovna The general argued
whim Aglaya Prince unfortunately
made remark confused child made blush
never would said sure Aglaya knew
well anything might heard prince Nastasia
Philipovna merely fabrication malicious tongues
woman going marry Rogojin He insisted prince
nothing whatever Nastasia Philipovna far liaison
concerned truth told added
never
Meanwhile nothing put prince continued
seventh heaven bliss Of course could fail observe
impatience Aglaya believed
something else nothing could shake conviction Besides
Aglaya frowns never lasted long disappeared
Perhaps easy mind So thought Hippolyte
events met park one day
Didn I tell truth I said love
said coming Muishkin accord stopping
The prince gave hand congratulated upon looking
well
Hippolyte seemed hopeful state health
often case consumptives
He approached prince intention talking sarcastically
happy expression face soon forgot intention
began talk He began complaining everything
disconnectedly endlessly wont
You believe concluded irritating
They wretchedly small vain egotistical
people Would believe invited express
condition I die quickly wild
possible died yet
contrary good deal better Isn comedy I mind betting
believe
The prince said nothing
I sometimes think coming said Hippolyte
carelessly So think capable inviting man
condition look sharp die
I certainly thought invited quite views
Ho ho nearly simple try make This
time I would tell thing two
beauty Gania hopes You undermined pitilessly
undermined really melancholy see calm
But alas nature help
My word thing melancholy Why think I
happier I feel disturbed excavations
tell
It better unhappy know worst happy
fool paradise I suppose believe rival
quarter
Your insinuations rivalry rather cynical Hippolyte I
sorry say I right answer As Gania I put
man happy mind passing
suffer I think best way look He
change yet lots time life rich
besides besides prince hesitated As undermined I
know world driving Hippolyte I think
better drop subject
Very well drop You look anything
exalted generous way You must put finger touch
thing believe eh Ha ha ha I suppose despise
dreadfully prince eh What think
Why Because suffered
No I unworthy sufferings like
Whoever suffer worthy suffer I think Aglaya Ivanovna
wished see read confession
She postponed pleasure I see I quite understand said Hippolyte
hurriedly though wished banish subject I hear
tell read nonsense aloud Stupid bosh
written delirium And I understand anyone I
say word would humiliating
say childishly vain revengeful
confession use weapon Don afraid I
referring
Oh I sorry repudiate confession Hippolyte
sincere know even absurd parts
many Hippolyte frowned savagely redeemed
suffering must cost something admit
say great torture perhaps I know Your motive must
noble one Whatever may appeared
contrary I give word I see plainly every day I
judge I merely say mind I
sorry I say
Hippolyte flushed hotly He thought first prince
humbugging looking face saw
absolutely serious thought deception Hippolyte
beamed gratification
And yet I must die said almost added man like
And imagine Gania annoys He developed idea
pretends believe probability three four others
heard confession die I There idea
way Ha ha ha In first place

He impaled stake time Peter
I know I know He lay fifteen hours hard frost died
extraordinary fortitude I know
Only God gives sort dying others
Perhaps think though I could die like Gleboff
Not said prince blushing I going say

like
I guess mean I Osterman Gleboff eh Is
meant
What Osterman asked prince surprise
Why Osterman diplomatist Peter Osterman muttered Hippolyte
confused There moment pause mutual confusion
Oh said prince last I going
say oh I think would ever like Osterman
Hippolyte frowned gloomily
I tell I draw conclusion explained prince
evidently desirous clearing matter little Because though
I often think men times I life
imagine like It really appears
another race altogether today At time
people seemed stick one idea nervous
sensitive enlightened people two three ideas
The man today broader man speak I declare
I believe prevents
independent brother earlier days Of course
remark made impression least
I quite understand You trying comfort naiveness
disagreed eh Ha ha ha You regular
child prince However I help seeing always treat
like like fragile china cup Never mind never mind I bit
angry At events funny talk Do know

I take trouble rise dead Osterman
However I see I must make arrangements die soon I
Well leave Look go give
opinion think I ought die I mean best
virtuous way Tell
You pass us forgive us happiness said prince
low voice
Ha ha ha I thought I thought I hear something like
Well really oh dear Eloquence eloquence

This injunction repeated several times man could
persuaded move Even turned back door came far
middle room went mysterious motions
designed convey suggestion prince open
letter He dare put suggestion words
After performance smiled sweetly left room tiptoe
All painful listen One fact stood certain
clear poor Aglaya must state great
distress indecision mental torment jealousy prince
whispered Undoubtedly inexperienced hot
proud little head sorts plans forming wild
impossible plans maybe idea frightened prince
could make mind Something must done
clear
He looked address letter Oh
least degree alarmed Aglaya writing letter could trust
What like could trust Gania
However made mind would take note
deliver Indeed went far leave house walk
road changed mind nearly reached Ptitsin door
However luckily met Colia commissioned deliver
letter brother direct Aglaya Colia asked questions

Arrived home prince sent Vera Lebedeff told
much necessary order relieve mind
dreadful state anxiety since missed letter She heard
horror father taken Muishkin learned
several occasions performed secret missions Aglaya
Rogojin without however slightest idea
might injure prince way
The latter one thing another disturbed
confused couple hours later message came
Colia general ill could hardly take news
However master fact acted upon tonic
completely distracting attention He went Nina
Alexandrovna whither general carried stayed
evening He could good people
near one blessing times Colia almost
hysterical state cried continuously running day
fetching doctors collected three going
chemist
The general brought round extent doctors
declared could said danger Varia Nina
Alexandrovna never left sick man bedside Gania excited
distressed would go upstairs seemed afraid look
patient He wrung hands prince spoke said
misfortune moment terrible
The prince thought knew Gania meant moment
Hippolyte house Lebedeff turned late
afternoon asleep ever since interview prince
morning He quite sober cried real sincerity
sick general mourning though
brother He blamed aloud explain He repeated
Nina Alexandrovna alone blame
one else acted pure amiable curiosity
deceased insisted upon calling still living
general greatest geniuses
He laid much stress genius sufferer idea must
one immense solace present crisis
Nina Alexandrovna seeing sincerity feeling said last
without faintest suspicion reproach voice Come
come cry God forgive
Lebedeff impressed words tone
spoken could leave Nina Alexandrovna
evening fact several days Till general death indeed
spent almost time side
Twice day messenger came Nina Alexandrovna
Epanchins inquire invalid
When late evening prince made appearance Lizabetha
Prokofievna found full guests Epanchin
questioned fully general soon appeared
old Princess Bielokonski wished know general
Nina Alexandrovna proceeded explain manner
pleased prince much
He relating circumstances general illness
Lizabetha Prokofievna spoke beautifully Aglaya sisters declared
afterwards modestly quietly without gestures many words
great He entered room propriety grace
perfectly dressed fall
slippery floor expressed evidently made
favourable impression upon assembled guests
As impression entering room taking seat
instantly remarked company least
Aglaya words led fear dreamed
nightmare form night
This first time life seen little corner
generally known terrible name He long
thirsted reasons penetrate mysteries
magic circle therefore assemblage greatest
possible interest
His first impression one fascination Somehow felt
people must born purpose together It
seemed Epanchins party
people must always one
returned among long absence one
naturally indisputably
It never struck refined simplicity nobility
wit personal dignity might possibly exquisite
artistic polish The majority guests somewhat
spite aristocratic bearing never
guessed composure much
superiority mere veneer indeed adopted unconsciously
inheritance
The prince would never much suspect thing delight
first impression
He saw instance one important dignitary old enough
grandfather broke conversation order listen
young inexperienced man listened seemed
attach value opinion kind amiable yet
strangers never seen Perhaps
appealed prince impressionability refinement old
man courtesy towards Perhaps soil susceptible nature
really predisposed receive pleasant impression
Meanwhile people though friends family
certain extent far intimate
friends family prince concluded There
present never would think considering Epanchins
equals There even hated one another cordially For
instance old Princess Bielokonski life despised wife
dignitary latter far loving Lizabetha
Prokofievna The dignitary General Epanchin protector
youth general considered majestic
personage would felt hearty contempt
even one moment allowed pose great man
equal think fear reverence anything less
Olympic God There others present met
years feeling whatever unless
dislike yet met tonight though seen
yesterday friendly intimate assembly kindred spirits
It large party however Besides Princess Bielokonski
old dignitary really great man wife
old military general count baron German name man reputed
possess great knowledge administrative ability He one
Olympian administrators know everything except Russia
pronounce word extraordinary wisdom admired
five years eternity service generally die
full honour riches though never done anything great
even hostile greatness This general Ivan
Fedorovitch immediate superior service pleased
latter look upon also patron On hand great
man consider Epanchin patron He always
cool taking advantage ready services
would instantly put another place
slightest reason change
Another guest elderly gentleman distant
relative Lizabetha Prokofievna This gentleman rich held
good position great talker reputation one
dissatisfied though belonging dangerous sections
class He manners extent English
aristocracy tastes especially matter
roast beef harness He great
friend dignitary Lizabetha Prokofievna reason
got hold idea worthy intended distant
date offer advantages hand heart Alexandra
Besides elevated solid individuals enumerated
present younger though less elegant guests Besides Prince S
Evgenie Pavlovitch must name eminent fascinating Prince
vanquisher female hearts Europe This gentleman
longer first bloom youth still
handsome He well lived rule abroad
noted good teller stories Then came guests belonging
lower stratum society people like Epanchins
moved occasionally exalted sphere The Epanchins liked
draft among elevated guests picked representatives
lower stratum Lizabetha Prokofievna received much praise
practice proved friends said woman
tact The Epanchins prided upon good opinion people held
One representatives present today
colonel engineers serious man great friend Prince
introduced Epanchins He extremely silent
society displayed forefinger right hand large ring
probably bestowed upon services sort There also
poet German name Russian poet presentable even
handsome sort man one could bring society impunity
This gentleman belonged German family decidedly bourgeois
origin knack acquiring patronage
retaining favour He translated great German poem
Russian verse claimed friend famous Russian
poet since dead It strange great multitude literary
people advantages friendship
great man profession unfortunately dead The
dignitary wife introduced worthy Epanchins This
lady posed patroness literary people certainly
succeeded obtaining pensions thanks
influence authority matters She lady
weight way Her age
young wife elderly husband dignitary She
beauty day still loved many ladies
love dress little smartly Her intellect nothing
boast literary knowledge doubtful Literary patronage
however much mania love gorgeous
clothes Many books translations dedicated
proteges talented individuals published
letters upon weighty subjects
This society prince accepted true
coin pure gold without alloy
It happened however particular evening good
people excellent humour highly pleased
Every one felt Epanchins greatest
possible honour presence But alas prince never suspected
subtleties For instance suspicion fact
Epanchins mind important step marriage
daughter would never think presuming take without
previously shown proposed husband dignitary
recognized patron family The latter though would
probably received news great disaster Epanchin family
perfect composure would nevertheless considered personal
offence dared marry daughter without advice
might almost say leave
The amiable undoubtedly witty Prince could feel
sun risen one night shine upon Epanchin
He accounted immeasurably inferiors

embrace faith unchristian Roman Catholicism speak
simply thing unchristianity added flashing eyes
seemed take everybody room
Come little strong murmured old man
glancing General Epanchin surprise
How make Roman Catholic religion
What asked Ivan Petrovitch turning prince
It Christian religion first place said latter
extreme agitation quite proportion necessity
moment And second place Roman Catholicism opinion
worse Atheism Yes opinion Atheism
preaches negation Romanism goes preaches
disfigured distorted Christ preaches I assure I
swear This personal conviction long distressed
The Roman Catholic believes Church earth stand
without universal temporal Power He cries non possumus In
opinion Roman Catholic religion faith simply
continuation Roman Empire everything subordinated
idea beginning faith The Pope seized territories
earthly throne held sword And thing
gone sword added lying intrigue deceit
fanaticism superstition swindling played fast loose
sacred sincere feelings men exchanged
everything everything money base earthly And
teaching How could upshot
Atheism Atheism child Roman Catholicism
proceeded Romans though perhaps would
believe It grew fattened hatred parents
progeny lies spiritual feebleness Atheism In country
among upper classes find unbelievers men
lost root spirit faith abroad whole masses
people beginning profess unbelief first
darkness lies surrounded
fanaticism loathing Church Christianity
The prince paused get breath He spoken extraordinary
rapidity pale
All present interchanged glances last old dignitary burst
laughing frankly Prince took good
look speaker The German poet came corner crept
nearer table spiteful smile
You exaggerate matter much said Ivan Petrovitch rather
bored air There foreign Churches many representatives
faith worthy respect esteem
Oh I speak individual representatives I merely
talking Roman Catholicism essence Rome A
Church never entirely disappear I never hinted
Agreed may true need discuss subject
belongs domain theology
Oh oh Not theology alone I assure Why Socialism
progeny Romanism Romanistic spirit It brother
Atheism proceed Despair opposition Catholicism It seeks
replace moral power religion order appease
spiritual thirst parched humanity save Christ
force Don dare believe God dare possess
individuality property ou la two million heads
By works ye shall know told And must
suppose harmless without danger Oh
must resist quickly quickly We must let Christ shine
forth upon Western nations Christ preserved
intact never known Not slaves allowing
caught hooks Jesuits carrying
Russian civilization must stand letting
said among us preaching skilful someone expressed
But excuse excuse cried Ivan Petrovitch considerably
disturbed looking around uneasily Your ideas course
praiseworthy highest degree patriotic exaggerate
matter terribly It would better dropped subject
No sir I exaggerate I understate matter anything
undoubtedly understate simply I express I
like
Allow
The prince silent He sat straight chair gazed
fervently Ivan Petrovitch
It seems painfully impressed news

kindly utmost calmness demeanour You excitable
perhaps result solitary life If would make
mind live among fellows society I trust I sure
world would glad welcome remarkable young man
would soon find able look things calmly You
would see things much simpler think
besides rare cases come opinion ennui
satiety
Exactly exactly That true thought cried prince From
ennui ennui satiety Oh wrong
Say like thirst fever And please
suppose small matter may laugh
dismiss must able foresee disasters arm
We Russians sooner arrive brink water
realize really brink delighted
outlook plunge swim farthest point

ascribe madness kindness heart
Our Russian intensity astonishes Europe wonders
conduct cases For one us goes Roman
Catholicism sure become Jesuit rabid one
bargain If one us becomes Atheist must needs begin
insist prohibition faith God force
sword Why Why exceed bounds Because
found land last fatherland sought vain
soul rejoiced find throws upon
kisses Oh vanity alone feelings
vanity Russians become Atheists Jesuits But spiritual
thirst anguish longing higher things dry firm land
foothold fatherland never believed
never knew It easier Russian become Atheist
nationality world And Russian become
Atheist actually Atheism though
found new faith perceiving pinned faith
negation Such anguish thirst Whoso country
That expression expression merchant
one Old Believers I met travelling He
say exactly words I think expression
Whoso forsakes country forsakes God
But let thirsty Russian souls find like Columbus discoverers
new world let find Russian world let search discover
gold treasure lies hid bosom land
Show restitution lost humanity future Russian
thought alone means God Christ Russian
faith see mighty wise good giant
rise eyes astonished frightened world
astonished expect nothing sword us
think get nothing us barbarism This
case longer matters go
proceeding clear truth I say I
But moment something happened put unexpected end
orator speech All heated tirade outflow passionate
words ecstatic ideas seemed hustle tumble
fell lips bore evidence unusually
disturbed mental condition young fellow boiled
remarkable manner without apparent reason
Of present knew prince listened
outburst state alarm feeling mortification It
unlike usual timid inconsistent
usual taste tact instinctive feeling higher
proprieties They could understand origin outburst
could simply news Pavlicheff perversion By ladies
prince regarded little better lunatic Princess
Bielokonski admitted afterwards another minute would
bolted
The two old gentlemen looked quite alarmed The old general Epanchin
chief sat glared prince severe displeasure The colonel
sat immovable Even German poet grew little pale though wore
usual artificial smile looked around see others
would
In point fact quite possible matter would ended
commonplace natural way minutes The undoubtedly
astonished collected General Epanchin several times
endeavoured interrupt prince succeeded
preparing take firmer vigorous measures attain end
In another minute two would probably made mind lead
prince quietly room plea ill

prince actually ill happened destiny something
different store
At beginning evening prince first came

The huge vase swayed backwards forwards seemed uncertain
whether topple head one old men
eventually determined go way came crashing
towards German poet darted way terror
The crash cry sight fragments valuable china
covering carpet alarm company meant
poor prince would difficult convey mind
reader imagine
But one curious fact shame vexation
mortification felt accident less powerful
deep impression almost supernatural truth premonition
He stood still alarm almost superstitious alarm moment
mists seemed clear away eyes conscious
nothing light joy ecstasy breath came went

looked around
For minutes seem comprehend excitement around
comprehended saw everything stood aside
like someone invisible fairy tale though
nothing going though pleased take
interest
He saw gather broken bits china heard loud

strangely gazing There hatred expression
anger whatever It full alarm sympathy
affection looked around others flashing angry
eyes His heart filled sweet pain gazed
At length observed amazement taken seats
laughing talking though nothing happened
Another minute laughter grew louder laughing

I mean exactly
If mean go steps

burned behind one sometimes one care return whence one
came Life need consist lunches dinners Prince
S It strikes take Aglaya Ivanovna conventional

Hippolyte went
There reason prince set anyone watch even
capable thing Aglaya command stay
home day seemed almost explained Perhaps meant call
might course anxious
make sure coming therefore bade remain
home His head whirled whole room seemed turning round He
lay sofa closed eyes
One way question decided last finally
Oh think Aglaya miss young
lady conventional type He long since feared might
take step But wish see Nastasia
He shivered lay high fever
No account child Certain looks certain
words late filled apprehension At times struck
putting great restraint upon
remembered alarmed observe He tried
days drive away heavy thoughts oppressed
hidden mystery soul The question long
tormented although implicitly trusted soul And
cleared It dreadful thought And woman
Why always feel though woman fated appear
critical moment life tear thread destiny
like bit rotten string That always felt ready
swear although half delirious moment If tried
forget time simply afraid
Did love woman hate This question
ask today heart quite pure He knew loved He
much afraid meeting strangeness
reasons might unknown afraid
woman Nastasia Philipovna He remembered days
afterwards fevered hours seen eyes
look heard voice strange words remembered
although could recollect details

He could remember Vera brought dinner took
whether slept dinner could recollect
He knew began distinguish things clearly moment
Aglaya suddenly appeared jumped sofa went

She gazed attentively
You quite ready I observe said absolute composure

He broke abruptly could add another word This one
attempt stop mad child made followed
though Confused thoughts
nevertheless capable realizing fact
go would go alone must go
hazards He guessed strength determination beyond
check
They walked silently said scarcely word way He
noticed seemed know road well
thought better go certain lane remarked
would quieter less public said
went
When almost arrived Daria Alexeyevna house
large wooden structure ancient date lady
young girl came Both ladies took seats
carriage waiting door talking laughing loudly
drove away without appearing notice approaching
couple
No sooner carriage driven door opened
Rogojin apparently awaiting let
closed
There another soul house excepting four selves
said aloud looking prince strange way
Nastasia Philipovna waiting first room went
She dressed simply black
She rose entrance smile give hand even
prince Her anxious eyes fixed upon Aglaya Both sat
little distance one another Aglaya sofa corner
room Nastasia window The prince Rogojin remained
standing invited sit
Muishkin glanced Rogojin perplexity latter smiled
disagreeably said nothing The silence continued
moments
An ominous expression passed Nastasia Philipovna face
sudden It became hard full hatred
take eyes visitors moment
Aglaya clearly confused frightened On entering
merely glanced momentarily rival sat still
eyes ground apparently thought Once twice
glanced casually round room A shade disgust visible
expression looked though afraid contamination
place
She mechanically arranged dress fidgeted uncomfortably
eventually changing seat end sofa Probably
unconscious movements unconsciousness
added offensiveness suggested meaning
At length looked straight Nastasia eyes instantly read
read rival expression Woman understood woman
Aglaya shuddered
You know course I requested meeting said last
quietly pausing twice delivery short sentence
No I know nothing said Nastasia drily abruptly
Aglaya blushed Perhaps struck strange impossible
really sitting waiting woman
reply question
At first sound Nastasia voice shudder ran frame
Of course woman observed took
You know quite well pretending ignorant said
Aglaya low eyes ground
Why I asked Nastasia Philipovna smiling slightly
You want take advantage position I
house continued Aglaya awkwardly
For position blame I said Nastasia flaring
suddenly invite moment I
quite ignorant I thus honoured
Aglaya raised head haughtily
Restrain tongue said I come fight
weapons
Oh come fight I may conclude Dear I
thought cleverer
They looked one another undisguised malice One women
written lately letters seen
dispersed first meeting Yet appeared
one four persons room considered degree
strange
The prince yesterday would believed could
even dream impossible scene stood listened
looked felt though long foreseen The
fantastic dream seemed suddenly metamorphosed
vivid reality
One women despised longed express
contempt perhaps come purpose
Rogojin said next day howsoever fantastical woman
howsoever afflicted spirit disturbed understanding
preconceived idea could possibly stand deadly
feminine contempt rival The prince felt sure Nastasia
would say nothing letters could judge
flashing eyes expression face thought
letters must costing moment He would given half
life prevent Aglaya speaking But Aglaya suddenly braced
seemed master fully instant
You quite understood said I come quarrel
though I like I came speak one
human another I came mind made I
say I shall change intention although may
misunderstand So much worse I wished
reply written reply personally I
think convenient way Listen reply
letters I began sorry Prince Lef Nicolaievitch
day I made acquaintance I heard afterwards
took place house evening I sorry
man simplicity
soul believed could happy woman character
What I feared actually took place could love tortured
threw You could love
proud proud error vain
quite either madness
Your letters proof You could love simple
soul perhaps heart despised laughed
All could love shame perpetual thought
disgraced insulted If less shameful
cause shame would still unhappy
Aglaya brought thronging words great satisfaction They
came lips hurriedly impetuously prepared
thought long ago even ever dreamed present
meeting She watched eagerness effect speech shown
Nastasia face distorted agitation
You remember continued wrote letter time
says know letter even read I
understand means letter understand correctly He
since confirmed I say word word
After receiving letter I waited I guessed would soon come
back could never without Petersburg still
young lovely provinces However
idea added blushing dreadfully moment colour
never left cheeks end speech When I next saw
prince I began feel terribly pained hurt account Do
laugh laugh unworthy understanding I say
Surely see I laughing said Nastasia sadly
sternly
However laugh please
When I asked told long since ceased
love recollection torture
sorry thought heart
pierced I ought tell I never life met man anything
like noble simplicity mind boundless trustfulness

Aglaya paused moment though suddenly brought
astonishment could said words time
great pride shone eyes like defiant assertion would

Aglaya flushed angrily
I wished find said firmly right

insulting shameful way
I never told either I loved replied Nastasia
Philipovna effort And I run away
right added scarcely audibly
Never told either cried Aglaya How letters
Who asked try persuade marry Was

confess I thought first anxious arouse aversion
heart meddling order I might give
afterwards I guessed truth You imagined
heroic action How could spare love
love vanity extent Why could

Why marry generous man loves done
honour offering hand It plain enough
marry Rogojin lose grievance nothing
complain You receiving much honour Evgenie Pavlovitch
saying day read many poems
well educated position live idleness Add
vanity reason enough
And live idleness
Things come unexpected point quickly Unexpected
Nastasia Philipovna way Pavlofsk thought considered
good deal expected something different though perhaps
altogether good interview Aglaya carried away
outburst rolling stone gathers impetus
careers downhill could restrain satisfaction
revenge
It strange Nastasia Philipovna felt see Aglaya like She
gazed could hardly believe eyes ears moment

Whether woman read many poems Evgenie
Pavlovitch supposed whether mad prince
assured Aglaya events woman spite
occasionally cynical audacious manner far refined
trustful sensitive appeared There certain amount
romantic dreaminess caprice fantastic
mingled much strong deep
The prince realized great suffering expressed
face
Aglaya observed trembled anger
How dare speak said haughtiness
quite indescribable replying Nastasia last remark
You must misunderstood I said said Nastasia
surprise
If wished preserve good name give
guardian Totski without theatrical posturing
said Aglaya suddenly propos nothing
What know position dare judge cried
Nastasia quivering rage growing terribly white
I know much go honest work went away
rich man Rogojin order pose fallen angel I
wonder Totski nearly driven suicide fallen angel
Silence cried Nastasia Philipovna You fit

court day She would understand better
Probably honest girl living toil Why speak
housemaid contemptuously
I despise toil I despise speak toil
If cared honest woman would gone
laundress
Both risen gazing one another pallid faces
Aglaya This unfair cried prince deeply distressed
Rogojin smiling sat listened folded arms
lips tight compressed
There look cried Nastasia trembling passion Look

governess Aglaya Ivanovna Oh fie shall I tell

audibly
Perhaps perhaps I worthy I know But I think

She fell back chair burst tears But suddenly new
expression blazed eyes She stared fixedly Aglaya rose

stay marry shall trot home alone
Shall I shall I say word screamed like madwoman scarcely
believing could really pronounce wild words
Aglaya made door terror stopped

Both Aglaya stood waited though expectation
looked prince like madwomen
But perhaps understand full force challenge
fact certain All could see poor despairing
face said Aglaya pierced heart ever
He could bear longer look entreaty mingled
reproach addressed Aglaya pointing Nastasia
How murmured unhappy
But time say another word Aglaya terrible look
bereft speech In look embodied dreadful suffering
deadly hatred gave cry flew
late
She could hold long enough even witness movement

The prince made rush caught held back The
distorted livid face Nastasia gazed reproachfully
blue lips whispered

Rogojin returned took sprinkled little face
She opened eyes moment understood nothing
Suddenly looked around shuddered gave loud cry threw
prince arms

Rogojin stared intently took hat without

A moments later prince seated Nastasia sofa

IX
A fortnight passed since events recorded last chapter
position actors story become changed
almost impossible us continue tale without
explanations Yet feel ought limit simple
record facts without much attempt explanation patent
reason greatest possible difficulty
accounting facts recorded Such statement part
may appear strange reader How anyone tell story
understand In order keep clear false position
perhaps better give example mean probably
intelligent reader soon understand difficulty More especially
inclined take course since example constitute
distinct march forward story hinder progress
events remaining recorded
During next fortnight early part July
history hero circulated form strange diverting
stories passed mouth mouth
streets villas adjoining inhabited Lebedeff
Ptitsin Nastasia Philipovna Epanchins fact pretty
well whole town environs All society
inhabitants place came evening
music got hold one story thousand varieties
detail certain young prince raised terrible
scandal respectable household thrown daughter
family engaged captured woman
shady reputation determined marry breaking
old ties satisfaction insane idea spite
public indignation roused action marriage take
place Pavlofsk openly publicly prince announced
intention going head erect looking whole
world face The story artfully adorned scandalous
details persons great eminence importance
apparently mixed time evidence
circumstantial wonder matter gave food plenty
curiosity gossip
According reports talented
every class society always haste explain every event
neighbours young gentleman concerned good family
prince fairly rich weak intellect democrat dabbler
Nihilism period exposed Turgenieff He could
hardly talk Russian fallen love one Miss
Epanchins suit met much encouragement
received house recognized young
lady But like Frenchman story told studied
holy orders took oaths ordained priest next
morning wrote bishop informing believe
God considered wrong deceive people live upon
pockets begged surrender orders conferred upon day
inform lordship sending letter
public press like Frenchman prince played false game
It rumoured purposely waited solemn occasion
large evening party house future bride
introduced several eminent persons order publicly make known
ideas opinions thereby insult throw
bride offensively possible resisting
servants told turn house seized
thrown magnificent china vase As characteristic addition
currently reported young prince really
loved lady engaged thrown
purely Nihilistic motives intention giving
satisfaction marrying fallen woman face world
thereby publishing opinion distinction
virtuous disreputable women women alike free
fallen woman indeed somewhat superior virtuous one
It declared believed classes anything else
excepting woman question
All looked likely enough accepted fact
inhabitants place especially borne less
daily occurrences
Of course much said could determined absolutely For
instance reported poor girl loved future
husband followed house woman
day thrown others said insisted
coming order shame insult taunts
Nihilistic confessions reached house However
things might public interest matter grew
daily especially became clear scandalous wedding
undoubtedly take place
So readers ask explanation wild
reports prince Nihilistic opinions simply
marriage could possibly satisfy real aspirations
spiritual condition hero time confess
great difficulty giving required information
All know marriage really arranged
prince commissioned Lebedeff Keller look
necessary business connected requested
spare expense Nastasia hurrying wedding
Keller prince best man earnest request
Burdovsky give Nastasia away great delight The
wedding take place middle July
But besides cognizant certain undoubted
facts puzzle us good deal seem flatly
contradict foregoing
We suspect instance commissioned Lebedeff
others prince immediately forgot masters
ceremonies even ceremony feel quite certain
making arrangements order might absolutely
escape thought wedding even forget approach
could detailing business concerning others
What think time What wish There
doubt perfectly free agent
far Nastasia concerned force kind brought
bear Nastasia wished speedy marriage true
prince agreed proposals agreed fact casually
anyone might suppose acceding simple
ordinary suggestion
There many strange circumstances us
opinion deepen mystery smallest
degree help us understand case
However let us take one example Thus know fact
whole fortnight prince spent days
evenings Nastasia walked drove began
restless whenever passed hour without seeing fact
appearances sincerely loved He would listen
hours time quiet smile face scarcely saying word
And yet know equally certainly period
several times set suddenly Epanchins concealing
fact Nastasia Philipovna driving latter absolute
despair We know also received Epanchins long
remained Pavlofsk allowed interview
Aglaya next day would set
errand apparently quite oblivious fact yesterday visit
failure course meeting another refusal
We know exactly hour Aglaya fled Nastasia
Philipovna house fateful evening prince
Epanchins appearance cause
greatest consternation dismay Aglaya home
family discovered first time two
Nastasia house together
It said Elizabetha Prokofievna daughters
denounced prince strongest terms refused
acquaintance friendship rage
denunciations redoubled Varia Ardalionovna suddenly arrived
stated Aglaya house terrible state mind
last hour refused come home
This last item news disturbed Lizabetha Prokofievna
anything else perfectly true On leaving Nastasia Aglaya
felt would rather die face people therefore
gone straight Nina Alexandrovna On receiving news Lizabetha
daughters general rushed Aglaya followed
Prince Lef Nicolaievitch undeterred recent dismissal
Varia refused sight Aglaya also The end
episode Aglaya saw mother sisters crying
uttering word reproach flung
arms gone straight home
It said Gania managed make fool even
occasion finding alone Aglaya minute two
Varia gone Epanchins thought fitting
opportunity make declaration love hearing
Aglaya spite state mind time suddenly burst
laughing put strange question She asked
whether would consent hold finger lighted candle proof
devotion Gania said looked comically bewildered
Aglaya almost laughed hysterics rushed
room upstairs parents found
Hippolyte told prince last story sending purpose
When Muishkin heard candle Gania finger laughed
quite astonished Hippolyte shuddered burst
tears The prince condition days strange
perturbed Hippolyte plainly declared thought
mind however hardly relied upon
Offering facts readers refusing explain
moment desire justify hero conduct On
contrary quite prepared feel share indignation
behaviour aroused hearts friends Even Vera
Lebedeff angry Colia Keller
selected best man Lebedeff began
intrigue pure irritation anon In
fact full accord certain forcible words spoken
prince Evgenie Pavlovitch quite unceremoniously course
friendly conversation six seven days events
Nastasia Philipovna house
We may remark Epanchins
anything thought right break prince
consequence conduct Prince even went far turn
away cut dead street But Evgenie Pavlovitch
afraid compromise paying prince visit
spite fact recommenced visit Epanchins
received redoubled hospitality kindness
temporary estrangement
Evgenie called upon prince day Epanchins
left Pavlofsk He knew current rumours fact
probably contributed The prince delighted see
immediately began speak Epanchins simple
straightforward opening quite took Evgenie fancy melted
plunged medias res without ceremony
The prince know Epanchins left
place He grew pale hearing news moment later
nodded head said thoughtfully
I knew bound Then added quickly
Where gone
Evgenie meanwhile observed attentively rapidity
questions simplicity prince candour
time evident perplexity mental agitation surprised
considerably However told Muishkin could kindly
detail The prince hardly knew anything first
informant household met since estrangement
Evgenie reported Aglaya really ill two
nights slept owing high fever
better serious danger still nervous hysterical
state
It good thing peace house events
continued They never utter hint past Aglaya
presence even among The old people talking
trip abroad autumn immediately Adelaida wedding Aglaya
received news silence
Evgenie likely going abroad also Prince S
wife affairs allowed general stay home
They estate Colmina twenty miles
Petersburg Princess Bielokonski returned Moscow
yet apparently staying reasons Lizabetha
Prokofievna insisted quite impossible remain
Pavlofsk happened Evgenie told
rumours current town affair could talk
going house Yelagin yet
And point fact prince added Evgenie Pavlovitch must
allow could hardly stayed considering
knew went place face daily
visits house visits insisted upon making spite
refusal see
Yes yes quite quite right I wished see Aglaya
Ivanovna know said prince nodding head
Oh dear fellow cried Evgenie warmly real sorrow
voice could permit come Of
course course I know unexpected I admit
naturally lost head could stop foolish
girl power I quite see much really
understood seriously cared She could
bear share another could bring throw
away shatter treasure Oh prince prince
Yes yes quite right said poor prince anguish
mind I wrong I know But Aglaya looked
Nastasia Philipovna one else know
But worst see
absolutely nothing serious matter reality cried Evgenie
beside Excuse prince I thought I
thought great deal I know happened
I know took place six months since I know
serious matter fancy smoke fantasy
distorted agitation alarmed jealousy absolutely
inexperienced girl could possibly mistaken serious reality
Here Evgenie Pavlovitch quite let go gave reins
indignation
Clearly reasonably great psychological insight drew
picture prince past relations Nastasia Philipovna
Evgenie Pavlovitch always ready tongue occasion
eloquence surprised From beginning said
began lie began lie bound end lie
law nature I agree fact I angry I
hear called idiot far intelligent deserve
epithet far unlike others
must allow Now I come conclusion basis
happened first innate inexperience
remark expression innate prince Then follows
simplicity heart comes absolute want sense
proportion want several times confessed lastly
mass accumulation intellectual convictions
unexampled honesty soul accept unquestionably also innate
natural true Admit prince relations Nastasia
Philipovna existed first something democratic
fascination speak woman question I know
scandalous scene Nastasia Philipovna house Rogojin
brought money six months ago I show
like I know exactly went every
detail things turned You thirsted
Switzerland Russia read doubtless
many books Russia excellent books I dare say hurtful
arrived fire longing
service Then day arrival tell sad
story woman tell knight pure without
reproach tale poor woman The day actually
attracted beauty fantastic almost demoniacal
beauty I admit beauty course
Add nervous nature epilepsy sudden
arrival strange town day meetings exciting scenes
day unexpected acquaintanceships day sudden actions
day meeting three lovely Epanchin girls among
Aglaya add fatigue excitement add Nastasia evening
party tone party expect
moment
Yes yes yes said prince nodding head
blushing slightly Yes nearly I know And
besides see I slept night train
night either I tired
Of course course quite I driving
continued Evgenie excitedly It clear possible
comprehensible enthusiasm plunge headlong
first chance came publicly airing great idea
prince man consider woman disgraced
sin disgusting social libertine
Oh heavens comprehensible enough dear prince
question unfortunately The question reality
truth feelings Was nature nothing intellectual
enthusiasm What think We told course
far worse woman find told
done well worthy honour respect Did
show real state case
months later The question whether innocent woman
I insist one way I wish
whole career justify intolerable pride insolent rapacious
egotism shown Forgive I violent perhaps
Yes I dare say say I dare say quite right
muttered prince She sensitive easily put
course still
She worthy sympathy Is wished say good
fellow But mere sake vindicating worthiness
sympathy insulted offended noble generous
girl presence This terrible exaggeration sympathy How
love girl yet humiliate throw
sake another woman eyes woman
already made formal proposal marriage And
propose know parents sisters
Can honest man prince act I ask And
deceive beautiful girl assured love
Yes quite right Oh I feel I guilty said
Muishkin deepest distress
But enough cried Evgenie indignantly As
enough simply say I know I guilty You blame
yet persevere Where heart I like
know time Did look though
suffering less moment You saw face suffering
less woman How could see suffering allow
continue How could
But I allow murmured wretched prince
How mean allow
Upon word I To moment I know
happened I I ran Aglaya Ivanovna Nastasia Philipovna fell
faint since day let see Aglaya
I know
It ought run Aglaya though
fainting
Yes yes I ought I She would died would
killed You know I told Aglaya
everything afterwards I see Evgenie Pavlovitch know
Tell I allowed see Aglaya I
cleared know Neither kept real point
see I could never explain I mean I think I could
Aglaya Oh God God You spoke Aglaya face
moment ran away Oh God I remember Come along
come along quick He pulled Evgenie nervously
excitedly rose chair
Where
Come Aglaya quick quick
But I told Pavlofsk And would use
Oh understand understand cried prince clasping
hands She would understand point
bit real point quite foreign real question
How foreign You going married Very
well persisting course going marry
Yes I shall marry yes
Then point
Oh point bit It makes difference
marrying means nothing
How means nothing You talking nonsense friend You
marrying woman love order secure happiness Aglaya
sees knows How say point
Her happiness Oh I marrying well wished
It means nothing She would certainly
died I see marriage Rogojin insane idea I
understand I understand know
two stood opposite one another I could bear Nastasia
Philipovna face You must know Evgenie Pavlovitch I never told
anyone even Aglaya I bear Nastasia Philipovna
He lowered voice mysteriously said You
described evening Nastasia Philipovna six months since
accurately one thing mention
took account know I mean
I looked face see Even morning I saw
portrait I felt I could look Now Vera
Lebedeff instance eyes quite different know I
face added real alarm
You

Do know certain asked Evgenie greatest
curiosity
Yes certain quite certain I discovered

What cried Evgenie horror You must
marrying solely I make head tail

And assured time love Aglaya
Yes yes oh yes
How Do want make love

Excuse prince think saying Recollect
Without Aglaya I I see Aglaya I shall die sleep
soon I thought I dying sleep last night Oh Aglaya
knew I mean really Because must know
first condition towards understanding Why ever know

know I talking I confused You pained
dreadfully Surely surely Aglaya expression
moment ran away Oh yes I guilty I
know I know Probably I fault round I quite know
I fault doubt There something else I
explain Evgenie Pavlovitch I words Aglaya
understand I always believed Aglaya understand I assured
No prince Aglaya loved like woman like human
like abstract spirit Do know poor prince
The probable explanation matter never loved
either one reality
I know perhaps right much said Evgenie
Pavlovitch You wise Evgenie Pavlovitch oh head
beginning ache Come quick God sake come
But I tell Pavlofsk She Colmina
Oh come Colmina Come let us go
No impossible said Evgenie rising
Look I write letter take letter
No prince must forgive I undertake
commissions I really
And parted
Evgenie Pavlovitch left house strange convictions He
felt prince must mind
And mean face fears yet
loves And meanwhile really may die says without seeing
Aglaya never know devotedly loves Ha ha ha
How fellow manage love two Two different kinds
love I suppose This interesting poor idiot What earth
become
X
The prince die wedding either day night
foretold might Very probably passed disturbed nights
afflicted bad dreams daytime among
seemed kind ever even contented little
thoughtful alone
The wedding hurried The day fixed exactly week
Evgenie visit prince In face haste
even prince best friends would felt
hopelessness attempt save poor Rumour said
visit Evgenie Pavlovitch discerned influence
Lizabetha Prokofievna husband But good souls
boundless kindness hearts desirous saving
eccentric young fellow ruin unable take stronger
measures attain end Neither position private
inclination perhaps naturally would allow use
pronounced means
We observed even prince nearest
neighbours begun oppose Vera Lebedeff passive disagreement
limited shedding solitary tears frequent
sitting alone home diminished frequency visits
prince apartments
Colia occupied father time The old man died
second stroke took place eight days first The
prince showed great sympathy grief family
first days mourning house great deal Nina
Alexandrovna He went funeral observable
public assembled church greeted arrival departure
whisperings watched closely
The thing happened park street wherever went
He pointed drove often overheard name
Nastasia Philipovna coupled passed People looked
funeral another
conspicuous absentee captain widow Lebedeff
prevented coming
The funeral service produced great effect prince He whispered
Lebedeff first time ever heard Russian
funeral service since little boy Observing looking
uneasily Lebedeff asked seeking
Nothing I thought I
Is Rogojin
Why
Yes church
I thought I caught sight eyes muttered prince
confusion But Why Was asked
Oh dear Why even know Anyone come
know Why look amazed I often meet I seen
least four times Pavlofsk within last week
I seen since day prince murmured
As Nastasia Philipovna said word met Rogojin
since day prince concluded latter
reasons wishing keep sight All day funeral
hero deeply thoughtful state Nastasia Philipovna
particularly merry daytime evening
Colia made prince father death
urged make use Keller Burdovsky promising
answer former behaviour Nina Alexandrovna
Lebedeff tried persuade wedding Petersburg
instead public fashion contemplated Pavlofsk
height season But prince said Nastasia
Philipovna desired though saw well enough
prompted arguments
The next day Keller came visit prince He high state
delight post honour assigned wedding
Before entering stopped threshold raised hand
making solemn vow cried
I drink
Then went prince seized hands shook warmly
declared first felt hostile towards project
marriage openly said
reason simply impatience friend
hoped see prince marry least Princess de Rohan de Chabot
saw prince way thinking ten times
noble rest put For desired neither
pomp wealth honour truth The sympathies
exalted personages well known prince highly
placed education sense exalted
personage
But common herd judge differently town
meetings villas band inns
coming event mentioned
shouts cries everybody I even heard talk getting
charivari windows So need
pistol honest man prince I ready fire half dozen
shots even rise nuptial couch
Keller also advised anticipation crowd making rush
ceremony placed entrance
house Lebedeff opposed measure said might
result place pulled
I assure prince Lebedeff intriguing He wants
put control Imagine To take use
money say two things
distinguish us animals I heard said positively It
sober truth
The prince recollected somebody told something kind
course scoffed He laughed
forgot hint
Lebedeff really busy little usual
plans become complex succeed sheer excess ardour
When came prince day wedding confess
always confessed persons intrigued
especially plan failed informed hero
born Talleyrand unknown reason become simple
Lebedeff He proceeded explain whole game prince
interesting latter exceedingly
According Lebedeff account first tried could
General Epanchin The latter informed wished well
unfortunate young man would gladly could save
think would seemly interfere
matter Lizabetha Prokofievna would neither hear see
Prince Evgenie Pavlovitch shrugged shoulders
implied business However Lebedeff
lost heart went clever lawyer worthy respectable
man knew well This old gentleman informed thing
perfectly feasible could get hold competent witnesses
Muishkin mental incapacity Then assistance
influential persons would soon see matter arranged
Lebedeff immediately procured services old doctor carried
latter away Pavlofsk see prince way viewing
ground give Lebedeff counsel whether
thing done The visit official
merely friendly
Muishkin remembered doctor visit quite well He remembered
Lebedeff said looked ill better see doctor
although prince scouted idea Lebedeff turned almost
immediately old friend explaining met
bedside Hippolyte ill doctor
something tell prince sick man
The prince course received plunged
conversation Hippolyte He given doctor account
Hippolyte attempted suicide proceeded thereafter talk
malady Switzerland Schneider
deeply old man interested prince conversation
description Schneider system sat two hours
Muishkin gave excellent cigars smoke Lebedeff part
regaled liqueurs brought Vera doctor
married man father family addressed compliments
filled indignation They parted friends leaving
prince doctor said Lebedeff If people put
restraint would one left Lebedeff
tragic tones told approaching marriage whereupon
nodded head replied marriages like
rare heard lady fascinating
extraordinary beauty enough explain infatuation
wealthy man thanks liberality Totski
Rogojin possessed heard money pearls
diamonds shawls furniture consequently could
considered bad match In brief seemed doctor
prince choice far sign foolishness denoted
contrary shrewd calculating practical mind Lebedeff
much struck point view terminated confession
assuring prince ready need shed
life blood
Hippolyte source distraction prince
time would send every hour day They
lived Hippolyte mother children small house
far little ones happy able
escape invalid garden The prince enough
keeping peace irritable Hippolyte mother
eventually former became malicious sarcastic subject
approaching wedding Muishkin took offence last
refused continue visits
A couple days later however Hippolyte mother came tears
eyes begged prince come back would eat
She added Hippolyte great secret disclose Of
course prince went There secret however unless reckon
certain pantings agitated glances around probably put
invalid begged visitor beware Rogojin
He sort man continued give object
know like prince belongs quite
different order beings If sets heart thing
afraid anything
Hippolyte ill looked though could long survive
He tearful first grew sarcastic malicious
interview proceeded
The prince questioned detail hints Rogojin He
anxious seize upon facts might confirm Hippolyte
vague warnings none Hippolyte private
impressions feelings
However invalid immense satisfaction ended seriously
alarming prince
At first Muishkin cared make reply sundry
questions smiled response Hippolyte advice run
life abroad necessary There Russian priests everywhere
one get married world
But Hippolyte last idea upset
What I really alarmed though said Aglaya Ivanovna
Rogojin knows love Love love You took Nastasia
Philipovna He murder Aglaya Ivanovna though
course still act would pain
He attained end The prince left house beside
terror
These warnings Rogojin expressed day
wedding That evening prince saw Nastasia Philipovna last
time meet altar Nastasia
position give comfort consolation On contrary
added mental perturbation evening went Up
time invariably done best cheer afraid
looking melancholy would try singing telling
every sort funny story reminiscence could recall The
prince nearly always pretended amused whether
actually often enough laughed sincerely delighted
brilliancy wit carried away narrative
often Nastasia would wild joy see impression
made hear laugh real amusement would
remain whole evening state pride happiness But
evening melancholy thoughtfulness grew every hour
The prince told Evgenie Pavlovitch perfect sincerity
loved Nastasia Philipovna soul In love
sort tenderness one feels sick unhappy child
left alone He never spoke feelings Nastasia
anyone even When together never
discussed feelings nothing cheerful
animated conversation outsider could heard Daria
Alexeyevna Nastasia staying told afterwards
filled joy delight look time
Thanks manner regarded Nastasia mental moral
condition prince extent freed perplexities
She quite different woman known three months
He astonished instance see impatient
marry formerly wept rage hurled curses
reproaches mentioned marriage It shows longer
fears would make unhappy marrying
thought And felt sure sudden change could
natural one This rapid growth could due
hatred Aglaya To suppose would suspect depth
feelings Nor could arise dread fate awaited
married Rogojin These causes indeed well others
might played part true reason Muishkin decided
one long suspected poor sick soul come
end forces Yet explanation procure
peace mind At times seemed making violent efforts
think nothing one would said looked
marriage unimportant formality future happiness
thing worth considering As conversations one held
Evgenie Pavlovitch avoided far possible feeling
certain objections could make answer
The prince observed Nastasia knew well enough Aglaya
He never spoke seen face
caught starting Epanchins house several occasions
When Epanchins left Pavlofsk beamed radiance
happiness Unsuspicious unobservant feared
time Nastasia might scheme mind scene
scandal would drive Aglaya Pavlofsk She encouraged
rumours excitement among inhabitants place
marriage prince order annoy rival finding
difficult meet Epanchins anywhere one occasion
taken drive past house He observe
happening almost passing windows
late anything He said nothing two days afterwards
ill
Nastasia try particular experiment A days
fixed wedding grew grave thoughtful She always
ended getting better melancholy becoming merry
cheerful quite unaffectedly happy

anguish
Meanwhile daylight grew full strong last prince

thronged found murderer unconscious raging fever
The prince sitting motionless time sick

If Schneider arrived seen former pupil
patient remembering prince condition first year
Switzerland would flung hands despairingly cried

Alexeyevna house telling knew threw state

Vera Lebedeff told knew Lebedeff advice decided

This came eleven clock next morning Rogojin
flat opened police presence Lebedeff two

friend gone upstairs secretly cautiously
After hesitation breaking open door since
could got open way
Rogojin suffered brain fever two months When recovered
attack brought trial murder
He gave full satisfactory direct evidence every point
prince name thanks brought proceedings
Rogojin quiet progress trial He
contradict clever eloquent counsel argued brain
fever inflammation brain cause crime
clearly proving malady existed long murder
perpetrated brought sufferings accused
But Rogojin added words confirmation view
recounted marvellous exactness details
crime He convicted extenuating circumstances
condemned hard labour Siberia fifteen years He heard
sentence grimly silently thoughtfully His colossal fortune
exception comparatively small portion wasted first
wanton period inheritance went brother great
satisfaction latter
The old lady Rogojin mother still alive remembers
favourite son Parfen sometimes clearly God spared
knowledge dreadful calamity overtaken house
Lebedeff Keller Gania Ptitsin many friends
continue live There scarcely change
need tell subsequent doings
Hippolyte died great agitation rather sooner expected
fortnight Nastasia Philipovna death Colia much
affected events drew nearer mother heart
sympathy Nina Alexandrovna anxious thoughtful beyond
years think make useful active man
The prince fate less decided Colia
selected persons met last six seven
months Evgenie Pavlovitch friend confidant To made
knew events recorded present
condition prince He far wrong choice Evgenie
Pavlovitch took deepest interest fate unfortunate
idiot thanks influence prince found
Schneider Switzerland
Evgenie Pavlovitch went abroad time intending live
long continent often said quite superfluous
Russia visits sick friend Schneider every months
But Schneider frowns ever shakes head
hints brain fatally injured yet declare
patient incurable allows express gravest
fears
Evgenie takes much heart heart proved
fact receives even answers letters Colia But
besides another trait character become apparent
good trait make haste reveal After visit
Schneider establishment Evgenie Pavlovitch writes another letter
besides Colia giving minute particulars concerning
invalid condition In letters detected one
last growing feeling friendship sympathy
The individual corresponds thus Evgenie Pavlovitch
engages much attention respect Vera Lebedeff We
never able discover clearly relations sprang
Of course root events already
recorded filled Vera grief prince account
fell seriously ill But exactly acquaintance
friendship came say
We spoken letters chiefly often
found news Epanchin family Aglaya particular
Evgenie Pavlovitch wrote Paris short
sudden attachment certain Polish count exile suddenly
married quite wishes parents though

Then six months silence Evgenie Pavlovitch informed
correspondent long letter full detail paying
last visit Schneider establishment come across
whole Epanchin family excepting general remained
Petersburg Prince The meeting strange one They
received Evgenie Pavlovitch effusive delight Adelaida
Alexandra deeply grateful angelic kindness
unhappy prince
Lizabetha Prokofievna saw poor Muishkin enfeebled
humiliated condition wept bitterly Apparently forgiven
Prince made sensible remarks It seemed Evgenie
Pavlovitch yet perfect harmony Adelaida
fiance thought time impulsive young girl would
let guided reason experience Besides recent
events befallen family given Adelaida much think
especially sad experiences younger sister Within six
months everything family dreaded marriage
Polish count come pass He turned neither count
exile least political sense word

It noble patriotism made great display
rendered interesting Aglaya eyes She fascinated
even marrying joined committee

visited confessional celebrated Jesuit priest made
absolute fanatic The supposed fortune count dwindled
mere nothing although given almost irrefutable evidence
existence Lizabetha Prokofievna Prince S
Besides married half year count

In word great deal say Epanchin
daughters even Prince still much distressed
Aglaya latest infatuations adventures care
talk though must known Evgenie knew much

Poor Lizabetha Prokofievna anxious get home according
Evgenie account criticized everything foreign much
hostility
They bake bread anywhere decently freeze
houses winter like lot mice cellar At events
I good Russian cry poor fellow added pointing
prince recognized slightest degree
So enough nonsense time faced truth All
continental life Europe trash
going abroad simply foolery mere foolery part
come Remember I say friend live agree
So spoke good lady almost angrily took leave Evgenie
